Playwright comes with the ability to generate tests for you as you perform actions in the browser and is a great way to quickly get started with testing. Playwright will look at your page and figure out the best locator, prioritizing [role, text and test id locators](./locators.mdx). If the generator finds multiple elements matching the locator, it will improve the locator to make it resilient that uniquely identify the target element.

## Generate tests with the Playwright Inspector

When running the `codegen` command two windows will be opened, a browser window where you interact with the website you wish to test and the Playwright Inspector window where you can record your tests and then copy them into your editor. 

### Running Codegen

Use the `codegen` command to run the test generator followed by the URL of the website you want to generate tests for. The URL is optional and you can always run the command without it and then add the URL directly into the browser window instead.

```bash
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 codegen demo.playwright.dev/todomvc
```

### Recording a test

Run the `codegen` command and perform actions in the browser window. Playwright will generate the code for the user interactions which you can see in the Playwright Inspector window. Once you have finished recording your test stop the recording and press the **copy** button to copy your generated test into your editor.

When you have finished interacting with the page, press the **record** button to stop the recording and use the **copy** button to copy the generated code to your editor.

Use the **clear** button to clear the code to start recording again. Once finished close the Playwright inspector window or stop the terminal command.

To learn more about generating tests check out or detailed guide on [Codegen](./codegen.mdx).

### Generating locators

You can generate [locators](/locators.mdx) with the test generator. 
* Press the `'Record'` button to stop the recording and the `'Pick Locator'` button will appear.
* Click on the `'Pick Locator'` button and then hover over elements in the browser window to see the locator highlighted underneath each element. 
* To choose a locator click on the element you would like to locate and the code for that locator will appear in the field next to the Pick Locator button.
* You can then edit the locator in this field to fine tune it or use the copy button to copy it and paste it into your code.

## Emulation

You can use the test generator to generate tests using emulation so as to generate a test for a specific viewport, device, color scheme, as well as emulate the geolocation, language or timezone. The test generator can also generate a test while preserving authenticated state.

### Emulate viewport size

Playwright opens a browser window with its viewport set to a specific width and height and is not responsive as tests need to be run under the same conditions. Use the `--viewport` option to generate tests with a different viewport size.

```bash
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 codegen --viewport-size=800,600 playwright.dev
```

### Emulate devices

Record scripts and tests while emulating a mobile device using the `--device` option which sets the viewport size and user agent among others.

```bash
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 codegen --device="iPhone 13" playwright.dev
```

### Emulate color scheme

Record scripts and tests while emulating the color scheme with the `--color-scheme` option.

```bash
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 codegen --color-scheme=dark playwright.dev
```

######

### Emulate geolocation, language and timezone

Record scripts and tests while emulating timezone, language & location using the `--timezone`, `--geolocation` and `--lang` options. Once the page opens:
1. Accept the cookies
1. On the top right click on the locate me button to see geolocation in action.

```bash
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 codegen --timezone="Europe/Rome" --geolocation="41.890221,12.492348" --lang="it-IT" bing.com/maps
```

### Preserve authenticated state

Run `codegen` with `--save-storage` to save [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) at the end of the session. This is useful to separately record an authentication step and reuse it later when recording more tests. 

```bash
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 codegen github.com/microsoft/playwright --save-storage=auth.json
```

###### 
<img width="1394" alt="github page before logging in csharp" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/220929619-28d4ed0c-d172-4cf1-b30b-bf5bed0e07bf.png" />

#### Login

After performing authentication and closing the browser, `auth.json` will contain the storage state which you can then reuse in your tests. 

<img width="1394" alt="login to Github screen" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/220561688-04b2b984-4ba6-4446-8b0a-8058876e2a02.png" />

Make sure you only use the `auth.json` locally as it contains sensitive information. Add it to your `.gitignore` or delete it once you have finished generating your tests.

#### Load authenticated state

Run with `--load-storage` to consume the previously loaded storage from the `auth.json`. This way, all [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) will be restored, bringing most web apps to the authenticated state without the need to login again. This means you can can continue generating tests from the logged in state.

```bash
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 codegen --load-storage=auth.json github.com/microsoft/playwright
```

## Record using custom setup

If you would like to use codegen in some non-standard setup (for example, use [BrowserContext.RouteAsync()](/api/class-browsercontext.mdx#browser-context-route)), it is possible to call [Page.PauseAsync()](/api/class-page.mdx#page-pause) that will open a separate window with codegen controls.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Playwright;

using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();
var chromium = playwright.Chromium;
// Make sure to run headed.
var browser = await chromium.LaunchAsync(new() { Headless = false });

// Setup context however you like.
var context = await browser.NewContextAsync(); // Pass any options
await context.RouteAsync("**/*", route => route.ContinueAsync());

// Pause the page, and start recording manually.
var page = await context.NewPageAsync();
await page.PauseAsync();
```
