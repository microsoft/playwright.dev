## Usage

```bash
# Install the CLI once.
dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.Playwright.CLI
# Use the tools.
playwright
```

## Install browsers

Playwright can install supported browsers.

```bash
# Running without arguments will install default browsers
playwright install
```

You can also install specific browsers by providing an argument:

```bash
# Install WebKit
playwright install webkit
```

See all supported browsers:

```bash
playwright install --help
```

## Generate code

```bash
playwright codegen wikipedia.org
```

Run `codegen` and perform actions in the browser. Playwright CLI will generate JavaScript code for the user interactions. `codegen` will attempt to generate resilient text-based selectors.

### Preserve authenticated state

Run `codegen` with `--save-storage` to save [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) at the end. This is useful to separately record authentication step and reuse it later.

```bash
playwright codegen --save-storage=auth.json
# Perform authentication and exit.
# auth.json will contain the storage state.
```

Run with `--load-storage` to consume previously loaded storage. This way, all [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) will be restored, bringing most web apps to the authenticated state.

```bash
playwright open --load-storage=auth.json my.web.app
playwright codegen --load-storage=auth.json my.web.app
# Perform actions in authenticated state.
```

### Codegen with custom setup

If you would like to use codegen in some non-standard setup (for example, use [BrowserContext.RouteAsync(url, handler)](./api/class-browsercontext.mdx#browser-context-route)), it is possible to call [Page.PauseAsync()](./api/class-page.mdx#page-pause) that will open a separate window with codegen controls.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Playwright;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();
        var chromium = playwright.Chromium;
        // Make sure to run headed.
        var browser = await chromium.LaunchAsync(new BrowserTypeLaunchOptions { Headless = false });

        // Setup context however you like.
        var context = await browser.NewContextAsync(); // Pass any options
        await context.RouteAsync('**/*', route => route.ContinueAsync());

        // Pause the page, and start recording manually.
        var page = await context.NewPageAsync();
        await page.PauseAsync();
    }
}
```

## Open pages

With `open`, you can use Playwright bundled browsers to browse web pages. Playwright provides cross-platform WebKit builds that can be used to reproduce Safari rendering across Windows, Linux and macOS.

```bash
# Open page in Chromium
playwright open example.com
```

```bash
# Open page in WebKit
playwright wk example.com
```

### Emulate devices

`open` can emulate mobile and tablet devices from the [`playwright.devices`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright#playwrightdevices) list.

```bash
# Emulate iPhone 11.
playwright open --device="iPhone 11" wikipedia.org
```

### Emulate color scheme and viewport size

```bash
# Emulate screen size and color scheme.
playwright open --viewport-size=800,600 --color-scheme=dark twitter.com
```

### Emulate geolocation, language and timezone

```bash
# Emulate timezone, language & location
# Once page opens, click the "my location" button to see geolocation in action
playwright open --timezone="Europe/Rome" --geolocation="41.890221,12.492348" --lang="it-IT" maps.google.com
```

## Inspect selectors

During `open` or `codegen`, you can use following API inside the developer tools console of any browser.

#### playwright.$(selector)

Query Playwright selector, using the actual Playwright query engine, for example:

#### playwright.$$(selector)

Same as `playwright.$`, but returns all matching elements.

#### playwright.inspect(selector)

Reveal element in the Elements panel (if DevTools of the respective browser supports it).

#### playwright.selector(element)

Generates selector for the given element.

## Take screenshot

```bash
# Wait 3 seconds before capturing a screenshot after page loads ('load' event fires)
playwright screenshot \
    --device="iPhone 11" \
    --color-scheme=dark \
    --wait-for-timeout=3000 \
    twitter.com twitter-iphone.png
```

```bash
# Capture a full page screenshot
playwright screenshot --full-page en.wikipedia.org wiki-full.png
```

## Generate PDF

PDF generation only works in Headless Chromium.

```bash
# See command help
playwright pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF wiki.pdf
```

## Install system dependencies

Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 system dependencies can get installed automatically. This is useful for CI environments.

```bash
# See command help
playwright install-deps
```

You can also install the dependencies for a single browser only by passing it as an argument:

```bash
playwright install-deps chromium
```

## Known limitations

Opening WebKit Web Inspector will disconnect Playwright from the browser. In such cases, code generation will stop.
