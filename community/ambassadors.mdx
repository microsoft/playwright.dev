Our Mission is to build an amazing Playwright community with the help of our ambassadors who are sharing their knowledge and passion for Playwright though live streams, video courses, conference talks and more.

## Join the Program

If you are creating video content, workshops, courses, conference talks and are sharing your knowledge of Playwright with the community then make sure to use our [Community Discord Server](https://aka.ms/playwright/discord). As well as our general channel for questions we also have channels for articles, conference talks and videos and will be watching out for new ambassadors through these channels and through our leaderboard. Feel free to reach out to us if you would like to know more. We would love to hear from you and see the amazing content you are creating.
