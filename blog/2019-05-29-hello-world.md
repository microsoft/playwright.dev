Playwright 1.6 is available today, with improvements to network capabilities: inspect WebSocket connections, export network activity as HAR and access resource timing for network responses. This release also adds a new API for touchscreen taps. Like other input methods, touchscreen taps auto-wait for the underlying element to be ready, to improve the reliability of automation.
