# Playwright MCP: Generating Tests

import LiteYouTube from '@site/src/components/LiteYouTube';

Imagine a scenario where you need to test a website but don't have access to the source code. Traditional testing approaches fall short when you only have a browser and a URL. This is where the powerful combination of Playwright Model Context Protocol (MCP) and GitHub Copilot transforms the testing landscape.

## Understanding the Problem

The difference between using Copilot alone and using the Playwright MCP is significant. While Copilot can generate test code based on source code, it cannot interact with live websites to understand their actual behavior. When you only have access to a browser and no source code, traditional AI-assisted testing approaches hit a wall.

This gap becomes a major barrier for black-box testing scenarios, where testers need to validate functionality without internal knowledge of the application structure.

## How Playwright MCP Changes the Game

The Playwright MCP serves as a bridge between AI and browser automation. It gives Copilot the ability to access and control a browser, enabling it to interact with web applications just like a real user would. The agent can then capture these interactions and transform them into reusable, automated test scripts.

This creates a powerful workflow where the agent can navigate websites, interact with UI elements via page snapshots, generate comprehensive test files, and validate functionality without requiring access to the application's source code.

## Setting Up Your Testing Environment

### Creating the Prompt File

The foundation of effective MCP testing lies in crafting a clear, directive prompt. Create a reusable prompt file in your `.github/prompts` folder called `generate-test.prompt.md`:

```markdown
---
tools: ['playwright']
mode: 'agent'
---

You are a playwright test generator. You are given a scenario and you need to generate a playwright test for it. DO NOT generate test code based on the scenario alone. DO run steps one by one using the tools provided by the Playwright MCP. Only after all steps are completed, emit a Playwright TypeScript test that uses @playwright/test. Save generated test file in the tests directory. Execute the test file and iterate until the test passes.
```

### Configuring the MCP Server

Ensure you have the [Playwright MCP server installed](./index.mdx#getting-started) and running locally. The server acts as the intermediary that allows Copilot to control browser instances and capture interaction data.

### Initiating the Process

With your prompt file ready and the MCP server running, drag and drop the prompt file into GitHub Copilot to provide context. Then specify your testing scenario in natural language. For example:

```
Generate a Playwright test for the following scenario: Navigate to [URL], search for Garfield, and verify the movie is in the list.
```

### AI-Driven Browser Automation

When you initiate the process using agent mode with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the agent begins by opening a browser window through the Playwright MCP server. This marks the beginning of autonomous test generation.

The agent navigates to your specified URL and begins exploring the interface. When it encounters challenges, such as needing to activate a search field before typing, it automatically takes page snapshots to understand the current state of the application.

### Intelligent Problem Solving

The page snapshots provide the agent with all accessible elements and their names, enabling it to make informed decisions about required interactions. When the agent discovers it needs to click a search icon before entering text, it adapts its approach automatically.

This intelligent problem-solving capability means the agent can handle dynamic interfaces and discover the correct interaction patterns needed to complete the specified scenario.

### Test Generation and Validation

Once the agent has completed the scenario, it automatically generates a comprehensive Playwright test file. This file captures all the necessary steps, navigation, element interactions, search actions, and verification, reflecting the manual process the agent performed.

Next, the agent executes the generated test to confirm it passes, providing immediate feedback and validation. This seamless workflow from scenario exploration to automated test creation and execution ensures your tests are both accurate and reliable.

To maximize the effectiveness of MCP generated tests, focus on crafting clear and detailed prompts. Specify each step of the user journey you want to automate. The more precise your instructions, the more closely the generated tests will match your requirements. Use these tests as a foundation for building out more robust test suites, and experiment with different AI models, to determine which produces the best results for your needs.
