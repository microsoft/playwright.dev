# Playwright MCP: Generating Tests

import LiteYouTube from '@site/src/components/LiteYouTube';

## Overview

Learn how to generate end-to-end Playwright tests using the Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with GitHub Copilot, even when you don't have access to the source code. This powerful approach enables black-box testing, AI-driven automation, and rapid test generation using natural language descriptions.

## What Makes MCP Different

Traditional AI code generation with Copilot works great when you have access to source code, but what happens when you only have a URL and a browser? That's where Playwright MCP shines:

- **No Source Code Required**: Generate tests for any website without needing the underlying codebase
- **Real Browser Interaction**: MCP gives Copilot actual browser access to interact with pages like a real user
- **Page Snapshots**: Uses the accessibility tree to understand UI elements and their accessible names

## How It Works

The Playwright MCP server acts as a bridge between GitHub Copilot and a real browser, enabling this workflow:

1. **Copilot opens a browser** using the MCP server
2. **Navigates to the target website** as specified in a prompt
3. **Takes page snapshots** to understand the page structure and available elements
4. **Interacts with the page** based on the test scenario
5. **Generates a Playwright test file** based on the actions taken
6. **Executes and validates** the generated test

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Tools Used

- **Playwright MCP**: [`https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)
- **GitHub Copilot**: Agent mode with custom prompts
- **AI Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (or similar LLM that supports MCP)

## Creating Effective Prompts

### Reusable Prompt Template

Create a reusable prompt file (e.g., `generate-test.md`) in a prompts folder inside the `.github` directory:

```markdown
# Playwright Test Generator Prompt

- You are a Playwright test generator
- You are given a scenario and you need to generate a Playwright test for it
- DO NOT generate test code based on the scenario alone
- DO run steps one by one using the tools provided by the Playwright MCP
- Only after all steps are completed, emit a Playwright TypeScript test that uses @playwright/test
- Save generated test file in the tests directory
- Execute the test file and iterate until the test passes
```

### Example Test Scenarios

#### Basic Navigation and Search
```
Generate a Playwright test for the following scenario:
- Navigate to [URL]
- Search for "Garfield"
- Verify the movie is in the search results list
```

#### Form Interaction
```
Generate a Playwright test for the following scenario:
- Navigate to [URL]
- Fill out the contact form with sample data
- Submit the form
- Verify success message appears
```

#### Multi-step Workflow
```
Generate a Playwright test for the following scenario:
- Navigate to [URL]
- Add multiple items to shopping cart
- Proceed to checkout
- Verify cart contents and total
```

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Start with Your Prompt

1. Drag and drop your reusable prompt file into Copilot chat
2. Add your specific test scenario

### 2. Watch the Playwright MCP Server in Action

Playwright MCP will:
- **Open a browser window** automatically
- **Navigate to your target URL**
- **Analyze the page structure** using accessibility snapshots
- **Adapt to UI challenges** (e.g., finding hidden search fields)
- **Perform the required actions** step by step

### 3. Intelligent Problem Solving

When the AI encounters issues (like a hidden search input), it will:
- Take a page snapshot to understand the current state
- Identify the correct element to interact with
- Adjust its approach (e.g., click search icon before typing)
- Continue with the test scenario

### 4. Test Generation and Validation

Once all actions are completed:
- A complete Playwright test file is generated
- The test is saved to your tests directory
- The test is executed to ensure it passes
- Any issues are debugged and fixed automatically

## Example Generated Test

Here's what a typical generated test might look like:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('search for Garfield movie', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to the website
  await page.goto('https://example-movie-site.com');
  
  // Click search icon to reveal search input
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Search' }).click();
  
  // Type search term
  await page.getByPlaceholder('Search movies...').fill('Garfield');
  
  // Submit search
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Search' }).click();
  
  // Verify Garfield appears in results
  await expect(page.getByText('Garfield')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering Tips

- **Be specific** about the exact steps you want to test
- **Use clear, natural language** descriptions
- **Break complex scenarios** into smaller, manageable steps
- **Specify verification points** clearly

### Handling Dynamic Content

- The MCP can adapt to dynamic UIs and changing page structures
- Page snapshots help identify the current state of elements
- Tests are generated based on actual page interaction, not assumptions

### Iteration and Refinement

- Generated tests are automatically executed and debugged
- Failed tests trigger automatic iteration until they pass
- You can refine prompts based on generated test quality

## Limitations and Considerations

### Context Window Management
- For longer test flows, break them into smaller scenarios
- The LLM may lose context with very complex multi-step workflows
- Consider generating multiple focused tests instead of one large test

## Next Steps

After successfully generating tests with Playwright MCP:

1. **Review and refactor** generated code to match your project standards
2. **Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline** for automated execution
3. **Create reusable prompt templates** for common testing scenarios

This approach revolutionizes how we think about test automation, making it accessible even when source code isn't available and dramatically speeding up the test creation process.
