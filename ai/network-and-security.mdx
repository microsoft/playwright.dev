# Networking and Security

## Overview

Never use Playwright or Playwright MCP to browse untrusted web content.

These options are for configuring proxies, origins, and security policies. To learn more about session and state see our guide: [Session and State](session-and-state.mdx).

## Allowing and Blocking Origins

You can control which domains the browser is allowed to access. Use `--allowed-origins` to whitelist specific domains and `--blocked-origins` to blacklist them.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--allowed-origins",
        "https://www.microsoft.com",
        "--blocked-origins",
        "https://www.google.com"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Blocking Service Workers

In some testing scenarios, service workers can interfere with network requests. You can block them entirely with the `--block-service-workers` flag.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--block-service-workers"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Using a Proxy Server

If you need to route traffic through a proxy, you can use the `--proxy-server` flag.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--proxy-server",
        "http://myproxy:3128"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To bypass the proxy for certain domains, use the `--proxy-bypass` flag with a comma-separated list of domains.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--proxy-server",
        "http://myproxy:3128",
        "--proxy-bypass",
        ".com,chromium.org"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
