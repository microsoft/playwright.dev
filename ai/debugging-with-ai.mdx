# Debugging with AI

## Overview

Debugging is a crucial part of the test development lifecycle, but it can often be time-consuming. With the power of AI, you can now accelerate the process of identifying and fixing test failures. This guide will show you how to leverage AI tools like GitHub Copilot directly within your Playwright workflow. You'll learn how to use features like "Copy Prompt" and "Fix with AI" to instantly get suggestions and fix failing tests from the Test Explorer, UI Mode, the HTML report, and the Trace Viewer, turning hours of debugging into minutes.

## 1. Copy Prompt (Faster Test Debugging)

When a test fails (in the HTML report, trace viewer, or UI mode) a **Copy prompt** button appears beside the error. It copies a pre-filled, context-rich prompt including:
- Error message & stack
- Snippet of the failing test body
- Relevant stdout / stderr (when available)

Paste it directly into your AI chat and ask: “Suggest the minimal fix and explain why.” This eliminates manual summarizing, reducing time-to-fix.

### UI Mode Debugging

For interactive debugging sessions:

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

**Workflow:**
1. **Launch UI Mode** using the command above
2. **Run the failing test** within the UI interface
3. **Click "Copy Prompt"** button when a test fails
4. **Paste into Copilot** or your preferred AI tool

**What the AI Prompt Contains:**
- **Full page snapshot** for visual context
- **Complete error message** with technical details
- **Relevant test code** showing the failing assertion
- **Additional debugging context** for comprehensive analysis

### HTML Report Analysis

After running your test suite with a failed test:

1. **Open the HTML report** (automatically generated on a failed test run)
2. **Navigate to failed tests** 
3. **Click "Copy Prompt"** for any failure
4. **Paste into any AI provider** (Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

This method is excellent for post-execution analysis and sharing debugging context with team members.

### Trace Viewer Debugging

For CI/CD and production failure analysis:

1. **Access the Trace Viewer** for failed tests
2. **Locate the AI prompt button** within the trace interface
3. **Copy the debugging prompt** with full execution context
4. **Analyze with AI tools** even when debugging remotely

**Advantages:**
- Works with CI failures where you can't run tests locally
- Provides complete execution trace context
- Enables remote debugging capabilities

## 2. Fix with AI In VS Code

When a test fails while in VS Code (with the Playwright VS Code extension), instead of manually analyzing stack traces, Copilot reads the complete context (snapshot diff, test code, error messages) and provides contextual, accurate fix suggestions. This enables one-click problem resolution.

**Workflow:**
1. **Locate the AI fix button** in the test failure output
2. **Click the button** to trigger AI analysis
3. **Review the suggested fix** from Copilot
4. **Accept the changes** and rerun the test
