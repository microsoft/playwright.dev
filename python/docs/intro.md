## Installation

Use npm or Yarn to install Playwright in your Node.js project. See [system requirements](#system-requirements).

```sh
npm i -D playwright
```

This single command downloads the Playwright NPM package and browser binaries for Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. To modify this behavior see [installation parameters](./installation.md).

## Usage

Once installed, you can `require` Playwright in a Node.js script, and launch any of the 3 browsers (`chromium`, `firefox` and `webkit`).

Playwright APIs are asynchronous and return Promise objects. Our code examples use [the async/await pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) to ease readability. The code is wrapped in an unnamed async arrow function which is invoking itself.

## First script

In our first script, we will navigate to `whatsmyuseragent.org` and take a screenshot in WebKit.

By default, Playwright runs the browsers in headless mode. To see the browser UI, pass the `headless: false` flag while launching the browser. You can also use `slowMo` to slow down execution. Learn more in the debugging tools [section](./debug.md).

## Record scripts

Command Line Interface [CLI](./cli.md) can be used to record user interactions and generate JavaScript code.

```sh
npx playwright codegen wikipedia.org
```

## TypeScript support

Playwright includes built-in support for TypeScript. Type definitions will be imported automatically. It is recommended to use type-checking to improve the IDE experience.

### In JavaScript

Add the following to the top of your JavaScript file to get type-checking in VS Code or WebStorm.

Alternatively, you can use JSDoc to set types for variables.

### In TypeScript

TypeScript support will work out-of-the-box. Types can also be imported explicitly.

## System requirements

Playwright requires Node.js version 10.17 or above. The browser binaries for Chromium, Firefox and WebKit work across the 3 platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux):
* **Windows**: Works with Windows and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
* **macOS**: Requires 10.14 or above.
* **Linux**: Depending on your Linux distribution, you might need to install additional dependencies to run the browsers.
  * Firefox requires Ubuntu 18.04+
  * For Ubuntu 18.04, the additional dependencies are defined in [our Docker image](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/utils/docker/Dockerfile.bionic), which is based on Ubuntu.
