## Browser dependencies

Playwright does self-inspection every time it runs to make sure the browsers can be launched successfully. If there are missing dependencies, playwright will print instructions to acquire them.

See also in the [browsers](./browsers.mdx#install-system-dependencies) doc which has a command to install all necessary dependencies automatically for Ubuntu LTS releases.

## Incompatible Microsoft Edge / Google Chrome policy settings

It's known that Playwright is not working as expected when some Microsoft Edge / Google Chrome policy settings are set. The following shows some of them, there might be more that affect Playwright's functionalities. If you find any other policy settings that break functionality, please file an issue and we'll add it to this document. You can see a list of applied policies by running `chrome://policy` in the browser.
-  `BrowserSignin` - This policy may prevent Playwright from launching the browser without signing in. Playwright will fail to launch browser if the policy forces users to sign-in to use the browser. See discussion in [this bug](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/22016)
- `ExtensionInstallForcelist` - This policy is used to specify a list of extensions that should be installed. Playwright's browser close will not work if this policy is set. See discussion in [this bug](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/17299).
- `UserDataDir` - This policy is used to specify the location of the user data directory. Playwright uses a temporary directory for user data, so this policy is not compatible with Playwright. See discussion in [this bug](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/17448).

## Python requirements

Playwright requires **Python 3.7** or newer.

## WebKit Web Inspector

Launching WebKit Inspector during the execution will prevent the Playwright script from executing any further and will reset pre-configured user agent and device emulation.

This is a known limitation.

## System requirements

The browser binaries for Chromium, Firefox and WebKit work across the 3 platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux):

### Windows

Works with Windows and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

### macOS

Requires 11 (Big Sur) or above.

### Linux

Depending on your Linux distribution, you might need to install additional dependencies to run the browsers.

:::note
Only Debian 11, Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 are officially supported.
