Playwright Trace Viewer is a GUI tool that helps exploring recorded Playwright traces after the script ran. Open traces [locally](#viewing-the-trace) or in your browser on [`trace.playwright.dev`](https://trace.playwright.dev).

## Recording a trace

Traces can be recorded using the [browser_context.tracing](/api/class-browsercontext.mdx#browser-context-tracing) API as follows:

<Tabs
  groupId="python-flavor"
  defaultValue="sync"
  values={[
    {label: 'Sync', value: 'sync'},
    {label: 'Async', value: 'async'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="sync">

```py
browser = chromium.launch()
context = browser.new_context()

# Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.
context.tracing.start(screenshots=True, snapshots=True, sources=True)

page.goto("https://playwright.dev")

# Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.
context.tracing.stop(path = "trace.zip")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="async">

```py
browser = await chromium.launch()
context = await browser.new_context()

# Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.
await context.tracing.start(screenshots=True, snapshots=True, sources=True)

await page.goto("https://playwright.dev")

# Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.
await context.tracing.stop(path = "trace.zip")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will record the trace and place it into the file named `trace.zip`.

## Viewing the trace

You can open the saved trace using Playwright CLI or in your browser on [`trace.playwright.dev`](https://trace.playwright.dev).

```bash
playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

## Actions

Once trace is opened, you will see the list of actions Playwright performed on the left hand side:

<img width="301" alt="Actions" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/883973/120588303-d39dd800-c3eb-11eb-9e8b-bfea8b775354.png"></img>

Selecting each action reveals:
- action snapshots,
- action log,
- source code location,
- network log for this action

in the properties pane. You will also see rendered DOM snapshots associated with each action.

## Screenshots

When tracing with the `screenshots` option turned on, each trace records screencast and renders it as a film strip:

You can hover over the film strip to see a magnified image:

That helps locating the action of interest very quickly.

## Snapshots

When tracing with the `snapshots` option turned on, Playwright captures a set of complete DOM snapshots for each action. Depending on the type of the action, it will capture:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
|Before|A snapshot at the time action is called.|
|Action|A snapshot at the moment of the performed input. This type of snapshot is especially useful when exploring where exactly Playwright clicked.|
|After|A snapshot after the action.|

<br/>

Here is what the typical Action snapshot looks like:

<img width="682" alt="Snapshots" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/883973/120588728-879f6300-c3ec-11eb-85d6-e67b0e92e4e3.png">

</img>

Notice how it highlights both, the DOM Node as well as the exact click position.

## Viewing remote Traces

You can open remote traces using it's URL. They could be generated in a CI run and makes it easy to view the remote trace without having to manually download the file.

```bash
playwright show-trace https://example.com/trace.zip
```

## Using [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev)

[trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) is a statically hosted variant of the Trace Viewer. 

### Viewing local traces

When navigating to [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev), you can upload trace files using drag and drop.

### Remote traces

You can also pass the URL of your uploaded trace (e.g. inside your CI) from some accessible storage as a parameter. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) rules might apply.
