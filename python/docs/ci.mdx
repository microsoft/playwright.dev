## Introduction

3 steps to get your tests running on CI:
1. **Ensure CI agent can run browsers**: Use [our Docker image](./docker.mdx) in Linux agents or install your dependencies using the [CLI](./cli.mdx#install-system-dependencies).
1. **Install Playwright**:
   
   ```bash
   pip install playwright
   playwright install --with-deps
   ```
   
1. **Run your tests**:
   
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
   
## CI configurations

The [Command line tools](./cli.mdx#install-system-dependencies) can be used to install all operating system dependencies on GitHub Actions.

### GitHub Actions

```yml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - name: Set up Python
    uses: actions/setup-python@v4
    with:
      python-version: '3.11'
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: |
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install -r local-requirements.txt
      pip install -e .
  - name: Ensure browsers are installed
    run: python -m playwright install --with-deps
  - name: Run your tests
    run: pytest
```

We run [our tests](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests_secondary.yml) on GitHub Actions, across a matrix of 3 platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and 3 browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).

### GitHub Actions on deployment

This will start the tests after a [GitHub Deployment](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/) went into the `success` state. Services like Vercel use this pattern so you can run your end-to-end tests on their deployed environment.

```yml
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  deployment_status:
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install Playwright
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
      env:
        # This might depend on your test-runner/language binding
        PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_BASE_URL: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}
```

### Docker

We have a [pre-built Docker image](./docker.mdx) which can either be used directly, or as a reference to update your existing Docker definitions.

Suggested configuration
1. Using `--ipc=host` is also recommended when using Chromium—without it Chromium can run out of memory and crash. Learn more about this option in [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#ipc-settings---ipc).
1. Seeing other weird errors when launching Chromium? Try running your container with `docker run --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN` when developing locally.
1. Using `--init` Docker flag or [dumb-init](https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init) is recommended to avoid special treatment for processes with PID=1. This is a common reason for zombie processes.

### GitHub Actions (via containers)

GitHub Actions support [running jobs in a container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/running-jobs-in-a-container) by using the [`jobs.<job_id>.container`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontainer) option.

```yml
steps:
  playwright:
    name: 'Playwright Tests'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.30.0-focal
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r local-requirements.txt
          pip install -e .
      - name: Ensure browsers are installed
        run: python -m playwright install --with-deps
      - name: Run your tests
        run: pytest
```

### Azure Pipelines

For Windows or macOS agents, no additional configuration required, just install Playwright and run your tests.

For Linux agents, you can use [our Docker container](./docker.mdx) with Azure Pipelines support [running containerized jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/container-phases?view=azure-devops). Alternatively, you can use [Command line tools](./cli.mdx#install-system-dependencies) to install all necessary dependencies.

For running the Playwright tests use this pipeline task:

```yml
jobs:
    - deployment: Run_E2E_Tests
      pool:
        vmImage: ubuntu-20.04
      container: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.30.0-focal
      environment: testing
      strategy:
        runOnce:
          deploy:
            steps:
            - checkout: self
            - task: Bash@3
              displayName: 'Run Playwright tests'
              inputs:
                workingDirectory: 'my-e2e-tests'
                targetType: 'inline'
                failOnStderr: true
                env:
                  CI: true
                script: |
                  npm ci
                  npx playwright test
```

This will make the pipeline run fail if any of the playwright tests fails. If you also want to integrate the test results with Azure DevOps, use the task `PublishTestResults` task like so:

```yml
jobs:
    - deployment: Run_E2E_Tests
      pool:
        vmImage: ubuntu-20.04
      container: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.30.0-focal
      environment: testing
      strategy:
        runOnce:
          deploy:
            steps:
            - checkout: self
            - task: Bash@3
              displayName: 'Run Playwright tests'
              inputs:
                workingDirectory: 'my-e2e-tests'
                targetType: 'inline'
                failOnStderr: true
                env:
                  CI: true
                script: |
                  npm ci
                  npx playwright test
            - task: PublishTestResults@2
              displayName: 'Publish test results'
              inputs:
                searchFolder: 'my-e2e-tests/test-results'
                testResultsFormat: 'JUnit'
                testResultsFiles: 'e2e-junit-results.xml' 
                mergeTestResults: true
                failTaskOnFailedTests: true
                testRunTitle: 'My End-To-End Tests'
              condition: succeededOrFailed()

```

Note: The JUnit reporter needs to be configured accordingly via

in `playwright.config.ts`.

### CircleCI

Running Playwright on CircleCI is very similar to running on GitHub Actions. In order to specify the pre-built Playwright [Docker image](./docker.mdx) , simply modify the agent definition with `docker:` in your config like so:

```yml
executors:
   pw-focal-development:
     docker:
       - image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.30.0-focal
```

Note: When using the docker agent definition, you are specifying the resource class of where playwright runs to the 'medium' tier [here](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference?#docker-execution-environment). The default behavior of Playwright is to set the number of workers to the detected core count (2 in the case of the medium tier). Overriding the number of workers to greater than this number will cause unnecessary timeouts and failures.

Similarly, If you’re using Playwright through Jest, then you may encounter an error spawning child processes:

```
[00:00.0]  jest args: --e2e --spec --max-workers=36
Error: spawn ENOMEM
   at ChildProcess.spawn (internal/child_process.js:394:11)
```

This is likely caused by Jest autodetecting the number of processes on the entire machine (`36`) rather than the number allowed to your container (`2`). To fix this, set `jest --maxWorkers=2` in your test command.

#### Sharding in CircleCI

Sharding in CircleCI is indexed with 0 which means that you will need to override the default parallelism ENV VARS. The following example demonstrates how to run Playwright with a CircleCI Parallelism of 4 by adding 1 to the `CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX` to pass into the `--shard` cli arg.

```yml
  playwright-job-name:
    executor: pw-focal-development
    parallelism: 4
    steps:
      - run: SHARD="$((${CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX}+1))"; npx playwright test -- --shard=${SHARD}/${CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL}      
```

### Jenkins

Jenkins supports Docker agents for pipelines. Use the [Playwright Docker image](./docker.mdx) to run tests on Jenkins.

```groovy
pipeline {
   agent { docker { image 'mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.30.0-focal' } }
   stages {
      stage('e2e-tests') {
         steps {
            // Depends on your language / test framework
            sh 'npm install'
            sh 'npx playwright test'
         }
      }
   }
}
```

### Bitbucket Pipelines

Bitbucket Pipelines can use public [Docker images as build environments](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-docker-images-as-build-environments-792298897.html). To run Playwright tests on Bitbucket, use our public Docker image ([see Dockerfile](./docker.mdx)).

```yml
image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.30.0-focal
```

### GitLab CI

To run Playwright tests on GitLab, use our public Docker image ([see Dockerfile](./docker.mdx)).

```yml
stages:
  - test

tests:
  stage: test
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.30.0-focal
  script:
  ...
```

## Caching browsers

By default, Playwright downloads browser binaries when the Playwright NPM package is installed. The NPM packages have a `postinstall` hook that downloads the browser binaries. This behavior can be [customized with environment variables](./browsers.mdx#managing-browser-binaries).

Caching browsers on CI is **strictly optional**: The `postinstall` hooks should execute and download the browser binaries on every run.

#### Exception: `node_modules` are cached (Node-specific)

Most CI providers cache the [npm-cache](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli-commands/cache.html) directory (located at `$HOME/.npm`). If your CI pipelines caches the `node_modules` directory and you run `npm install` (instead of `npm ci`), the default configuration

**will not work**. This is because the `npm install` step will find the Playwright NPM package on disk and not execute the `postinstall` step.

> Travis CI automatically caches `node_modules` if your repo does not have a `package-lock.json` file.

This behavior can be fixed with one of the following approaches:
1. Move to caching `$HOME/.npm` or the npm-cache directory. (This is the default behavior in most CI providers.)
1. Set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0` as the environment variable before running `npm install`. This will download the browser binaries in the `node_modules` directory and cache them with the package code. See [managing browser binaries](./browsers.mdx#managing-browser-binaries).
1. Use `npm ci` (instead of `npm install`) which forces a clean install: by removing the existing `node_modules` directory. See [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci.html).
1. Cache the browser binaries, with the steps below.

#### Directories to cache

With the default behavior, Playwright downloads the browser binaries in the following directories:
- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright` on Windows
- `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` on MacOS
- `~/.cache/ms-playwright` on Linux

To cache the browser downloads between CI runs, cache this location in your CI configuration, against a hash of the Playwright version.

## Debugging browser launches

Playwright supports the `DEBUG` environment variable to output debug logs during execution. Setting it to `pw:browser*` is helpful while debugging `Error: Failed to launch browser` errors.

```bash
DEBUG=pw:browser* pytest
```

## Running headed

By default, Playwright launches browsers in headless mode. This can be changed by passing a flag when the browser is launched.

<Tabs
  groupId="python-flavor"
  defaultValue="sync"
  values={[
    {label: 'Sync', value: 'sync'},
    {label: 'Async', value: 'async'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="sync">

```py
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
   # Works across chromium, firefox and webkit
   browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="async">

```py
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
         # Works across chromium, firefox and webkit
         browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=False)

asyncio.run(main())
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

On Linux agents, headed execution requires [Xvfb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb) to be installed. Our [Docker image](./docker.mdx) and GitHub Action have Xvfb pre-installed. To run browsers in headed mode with Xvfb, add `xvfb-run` before the Node.js command.

```bash
xvfb-run python test.py
```
