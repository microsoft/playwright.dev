## Annotations

Playwright Test supports test annotations to deal with failures, flakiness, skip, focus and tag tests:
- `skip` marks the test as irrelevant. Playwright Test does not run such a test. Use this annotation when the test is not applicable in some configuration.
- `fail` marks the test as failing. Playwright Test will run this test and ensure it does indeed fail. If the test does not fail, Playwright Test will complain.
- `fixme` marks the test as failing. Playwright Test will not run this test, as opposite to the `fail` annotation. Use `fixme` when running the test is slow or crashy.
- `slow` marks the test as slow and triples the test timeout.

## Focus a test

You can focus some tests. When there are focused tests, only these tests run.

## Skip a test

You can skip certain tests based on the condition.

## Group tests

You can group tests to give them a logical name or to scope before/after hooks to the group.

Annotations apply when the condition is truthy, or always when no condition is passed, and may include a description. Annotations may depend on test fixtures. There could be multiple annotations on the same test, possibly in different configurations.

Available annotations:
- `skip` marks the test as irrelevant. Playwright Test does not run such a test. Use this annotation when the test is not applicable in some configuration.
- `fail` marks the test as failing. Playwright Test will run this test and ensure it does indeed fail. If the test does not fail, Playwright Test will complain.
- `fixme` marks the test as failing. Playwright Test will not run this test, as opposite to the `fail` annotation. Use `fixme` when running the test is slow or crashy.
- `slow` marks the test as slow and triples the test timeout.

## Tag tests

Sometimes you want to tag your tests as `@fast` or `@slow` and only run the tests that have the certain tag. We recommend that you use the `--grep` and `--grep-invert` command line flags for that:

You will then be able to run only that test:

```bash
npx playwright test --grep @fast
```

Or if you want the opposite, you can skip the tests with a certain tag:

```bash
npx playwright test --grep-invert @slow
```
