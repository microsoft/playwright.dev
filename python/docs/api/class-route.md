Whenever a network route is set up with [page.route(url, handler)](./api/class-page.md#pagerouteurl-handler) or [browser_context.route(url, handler)](./api/class-browsercontext.md#browsercontextrouteurl-handler), the `Route` object allows to handle the route.


- [route.abort(**options)](./api/class-route.md#routeabortoptions)
- [route.continue(**options)](./api/class-route.md#routecontinueoptions)
- [route.fulfill(**options)](./api/class-route.md#routefulfilloptions)
- [route.request()](./api/class-route.md#routerequest)

## route.abort(**options)
- `error_code` <[str]> Optional error code. Defaults to `failed`, could be one of the following:
  * `'aborted'` - An operation was aborted (due to user action)
  * `'accessdenied'` - Permission to access a resource, other than the network, was denied
  * `'addressunreachable'` - The IP address is unreachable. This usually means that there is no route to the specified host or network.
  * `'blockedbyclient'` - The client chose to block the request.
  * `'blockedbyresponse'` - The request failed because the response was delivered along with requirements which are not met ('X-Frame-Options' and 'Content-Security-Policy' ancestor checks, for instance).
  * `'connectionaborted'` - A connection timed out as a result of not receiving an ACK for data sent.
  * `'connectionclosed'` - A connection was closed (corresponding to a TCP FIN).
  * `'connectionfailed'` - A connection attempt failed.
  * `'connectionrefused'` - A connection attempt was refused.
  * `'connectionreset'` - A connection was reset (corresponding to a TCP RST).
  * `'internetdisconnected'` - The Internet connection has been lost.
  * `'namenotresolved'` - The host name could not be resolved.
  * `'timedout'` - An operation timed out.
  * `'failed'` - A generic failure occurred.

Aborts the route's request.

## route.continue(**options)
- `url` <[str]> If set changes the request URL. New URL must have same protocol as original one.
- `method` <[str]> If set changes the request method (e.g. GET or POST)
- `post_data` <[str]|[Buffer]> If set changes the post data of request
- `headers` <[Dict]\[[str], [str]\]> If set changes the request HTTP headers. Header values will be converted to a string.

Continues route's request with optional overrides.

## route.fulfill(**options)
- `status` <[int]> Response status code, defaults to `200`.
- `headers` <[Dict]\[[str], [str]\]> Optional response headers. Header values will be converted to a string.
- `content_type` <[str]> If set, equals to setting `Content-Type` response header.
- `body` <[str]|[Buffer]> Optional response body.
- `path` <[Union]\[[str], [pathlib.Path]\]> Optional file path to respond with. The content type will be inferred from file extension. If `path` is a relative path, then it is resolved relative to the current working directory.

Fulfills route's request with given response.
