Playwright module provides a method to launch a browser instance. The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:

<Tabs
  groupId="python-flavor"
  defaultValue="sync"
  values={[
    {label: 'Sync', value: 'sync'},
    {label: 'Async', value: 'async'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="sync">

```py
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright

def run(playwright: Playwright):
    chromium = playwright.chromium # or "firefox" or "webkit".
    browser = chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("http://example.com")
    # other actions...
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="async">

```py
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright, Playwright

async def run(playwright: Playwright):
    chromium = playwright.chromium # or "firefox" or "webkit".
    browser = await chromium.launch()
    page = await browser.new_page()
    await page.goto("http://example.com")
    # other actions...
    await browser.close()

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await run(playwright)
asyncio.run(main())
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Methods

### stop {#playwright-stop}

<font size="2" style={{position: "relative", top: "-20px"}}>Added before v1.9</font><x-search>playwright.stop</x-search>

Terminates this instance of Playwright in case it was created bypassing the Python context manager. This is useful in REPL applications.

```py
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

playwright = sync_playwright().start()

browser = playwright.chromium.launch()
page = browser.new_page()
page.goto("https://playwright.dev/")
page.screenshot(path="example.png")
browser.close()

playwright.stop()
```

**Usage**

```python
playwright.stop()
```

**Returns**
- [NoneType]<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" class="list-anchor-link" id="playwright-stop-return"/><a href="#playwright-stop-return" class="list-anchor">#</a>
