Playwright module provides a method to launch a browser instance. The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:

<Tabs
  groupId="python-flavor"
  defaultValue="sync"
  values={[
    {label: 'Sync', value: 'sync'},
    {label: 'Async', value: 'async'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="sync">

```py
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    chromium = playwright.chromium # or "firefox" or "webkit".
    browser = chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("http://example.com")
    # other actions...
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="async">

```py
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run(playwright):
    chromium = playwright.chromium # or "firefox" or "webkit".
    browser = await chromium.launch()
    page = await browser.new_page()
    await page.goto("http://example.com")
    # other actions...
    await browser.close()

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await run(playwright)
asyncio.run(main())
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## playwright.stop()
- returns: <[NoneType]>

Terminates this instance of Playwright in case it was created bypassing the Python context manager. This is useful in REPL applications.

```py
>>> from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

>>> playwright = sync_playwright().start()

>>> browser = playwright.chromium.launch()
>>> page = browser.new_page()
>>> page.goto("http://whatsmyuseragent.org/")
>>> page.screenshot(path="example.png")
>>> browser.close()

>>> playwright.stop()
```

## playwright.chromium
- type: <[BrowserType]>

This object can be used to launch or connect to Chromium, returning instances of [Browser].

## playwright.devices
- type: <[Dict]>

Returns a dictionary of devices to be used with [browser.new_context(**kwargs)](./api/class-browser.mdx#browsernew_contextkwargs) or [browser.new_page(**kwargs)](./api/class-browser.mdx#browsernew_pagekwargs).

  values={[
    {label: 'Sync', value: 'sync'},
    {label: 'Async', value: 'async'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="sync">

```py
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    webkit = playwright.webkit
    iphone = playwright.devices["iPhone 6"]
    browser = webkit.launch()
    context = browser.new_context(**iphone)
    page = context.new_page()
    page.goto("http://example.com")
    # other actions...
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="async">

```py
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def run(playwright):
    webkit = playwright.webkit
    iphone = playwright.devices["iPhone 6"]
    browser = await webkit.launch()
    context = await browser.new_context(**iphone)
    page = await context.new_page()
    await page.goto("http://example.com")
    # other actions...
    await browser.close()

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await run(playwright)
asyncio.run(main())
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## playwright.firefox
- type: <[BrowserType]>

This object can be used to launch or connect to Firefox, returning instances of [Browser].

## playwright.selectors
- type: <[Selectors]>

Selectors can be used to install custom selector engines. See [Working with selectors](./selectors.mdx) for more information.

## playwright.webkit
- type: <[BrowserType]>

This object can be used to launch or connect to WebKit, returning instances of [Browser].
