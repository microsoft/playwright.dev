Playwright comes with the command line tools that run via `npx` or as a part of the `npm` scripts.

## Usage

```sh
playwright
```

## Generate code

```sh
playwright codegen wikipedia.org
```

Run `codegen` and perform actions in the browser. Playwright CLI will generate JavaScript code for the user interactions. `codegen` will attempt to generate resilient text-based selectors.

### Preserve authenticated state

Run `codegen` with `--save-storage` to save [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) at the end. This is useful to separately record authentication step and reuse it later.

```sh
playwright codegen --save-storage=auth.json
# Perform authentication and exit.
# auth.json will contain the storage state.
```

Run with `--load-storage` to consume previously loaded storage. This way, all [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) will be restored, bringing most web apps to the authenticated state.

```sh
playwright open --load-storage=auth.json my.web.app
playwright codegen --load-storage=auth.json my.web.app
# Perform actions in authenticated state.
```

### Codegen with custom setup

If you would like to use codegen in some non-standard setup (for example, use [browser_context.route(url, handler)](./api/class-browsercontext.mdx#browser_contextrouteurl-handler)), it is possible to call [page.pause()](./api/class-page.mdx#pagepause) that will open a separate window with codegen controls.

<Tabs
  groupId="python-flavor"
  defaultValue="sync"
  values={[
    {label: 'Sync', value: 'sync'},
    {label: 'Async', value: 'async'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="sync">

```py
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    # Make sure to run headed.
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)

    # Setup context however you like.
    context = browser.new_context() # Pass any options
    context.route('**/*', lambda route: route.continue_())

    # Pause the page, and start recording manually.
    page = context.new_page()
    page.pause()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="async">

```py
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        # Make sure to run headed.
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=False)

        # Setup context however you like.
        context = await browser.new_context() # Pass any options
        await context.route('**/*', lambda route: route.continue_())

        # Pause the page, and start recording manually.
        page = await context.new_page()
        await page.pause()

asyncio.run(main())
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Open pages

With `open`, you can use Playwright bundled browsers to browse web pages. Playwright provides cross-platform WebKit builds that can be used to reproduce Safari rendering across Windows, Linux and macOS.

```sh
# Open page in Chromium
playwright open example.com
```

```sh
# Open page in WebKit
playwright wk example.com
```

### Emulate devices

`open` can emulate mobile and tablet devices from the [`playwright.devices`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright#playwrightdevices) list.

```sh
# Emulate iPhone 11.
playwright open --device="iPhone 11" wikipedia.org
```

### Emulate color scheme and viewport size

```sh
# Emulate screen size and color scheme.
playwright open --viewport-size=800,600 --color-scheme=dark twitter.com
```

### Emulate geolocation, language and timezone

```sh
# Emulate timezone, language & location
# Once page opens, click the "my location" button to see geolocation in action
playwright open --timezone="Europe/Rome" --geolocation="41.890221,12.492348" --lang="it-IT" maps.google.com
```

## Inspect selectors

During `open` or `codegen`, you can use following API inside the developer tools console of any browser.

#### playwright.$(selector)

Query Playwright selector, using the actual Playwright query engine, for example:

#### playwright.$$(selector)

Same as `playwright.$`, but returns all matching elements.

#### playwright.inspect(selector)

Reveal element in the Elements panel (if DevTools of the respective browser supports it).

#### playwright.selector(element)

Generates selector for the given element.

## Take screenshot

```sh
# See command help
playwright screenshot --help
```

```sh
# Wait 3 seconds before capturing a screenshot after page loads ('load' event fires)
playwright screenshot \
    --device="iPhone 11" \
    --color-scheme=dark \
    --wait-for-timeout=3000 \
    twitter.com twitter-iphone.png
```

```sh
# Capture a full page screenshot
playwright screenshot --full-page en.wikipedia.org wiki-full.png
```

## Generate PDF

PDF generation only works in Headless Chromium.

```sh
# See command help
playwright pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF wiki.pdf
```

## Install system dependencies

Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 system dependencies can get installed automatically. This is useful for CI environments.

```sh
# See command help
playwright install-deps
```

You can also install the dependencies for a single browser only by passing it as an argument:

```sh
playwright install-deps chromium
```

## Known limitations

Opening WebKit Web Inspector will disconnect Playwright from the browser. In such cases, code generation will stop.
