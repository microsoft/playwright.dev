Playwright comes with the command line tools that run via `npx` or as a part of the `npm` scripts.

## Usage

```sh
$ python -m playwright
```

Running from `package.json` script

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "help": "playwright --help"
  }
}
```

## Generate code

```sh
$ python -m playwright codegen wikipedia.org
```

Run `codegen` and perform actions in the browser. Playwright CLI will generate JavaScript code for the user interactions. `codegen` will attempt to generate resilient text-based selectors.

### Preserve authenticated state

Run `codegen` with `--save-storage` to save [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) at the end. This is useful to separately record authentication step and reuse it later.

```sh
$ python -m playwright --save-storage=auth.json codegen
# Perform authentication and exit.
# auth.json will contain the storage state.
```

Run with `--load-storage` to consume previously loaded storage. This way, all [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) will be restored, bringing most web apps to the authenticated state.

```sh
$ python -m playwright --load-storage=auth.json open my.web.app
$ python -m playwright --load-storage=auth.json codegen my.web.app
# Perform actions in authenticated state.
```

## Open pages

With `open`, you can use Playwright bundled browsers to browse web pages. Playwright provides cross-platform WebKit builds that can be used to reproduce Safari rendering across Windows, Linux and macOS.

```sh
# Open page in Chromium
$ python -m playwright open example.com
```

```sh
# Open page in WebKit
$ python -m playwright wk example.com
```

### Emulate devices

`open` can emulate mobile and tablet devices ([see all devices](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/src/server/deviceDescriptors.ts)).

```sh
# Emulate iPhone 11.
$ python -m playwright --device="iPhone 11" open wikipedia.org
```

### Emulate color scheme and viewport size

```sh
# Emulate screen size and color scheme.
$ python -m playwright --viewport-size=800,600 --color-scheme=dark open twitter.com
```

### Emulate geolocation, language and timezone

```sh
# Emulate timezone, language & location
# Once page opens, click the "my location" button to see geolocation in action
$ python -m playwright --timezone="Europe/Rome" --geolocation="41.890221,12.492348" --lang="it-IT" open maps.google.com
```

## Inspect selectors

During `open` or `codegen`, you can use following API inside the developer tools console of any browser.

#### playwright.$(selector)

Query Playwright selector, using the actual Playwright query engine, for example:

#### playwright.$$(selector)

Same as `playwright.$`, but returns all matching elements.

#### playwright.inspect(selector)

Reveal element in the Elements panel (if DevTools of the respective browser supports it).

#### playwright.selector(element)

Generates selector for the given element.

## Take screenshot

```sh
# See command help
$ python -m playwright screenshot --help
```

```sh
# Wait 3 seconds before capturing a screenshot after page loads ('load' event fires)
$ python -m playwright \
  --device="iPhone 11" \
  --color-scheme=dark \
  screenshot \
    --wait-for-timeout=3000 \
    twitter.com twitter-iphone.png
```

```sh
# Capture a full page screenshot
$ python -m playwright screenshot --full-page en.wikipedia.org wiki-full.png
```

## Generate PDF

PDF generation only works in Headless Chromium.

```sh
# See command help
$ python -m playwright pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF wiki.pdf
```

## Known limitations

Opening WebKit Web Inspector will disconnect Playwright from the browser. In such cases, code generation will stop.
