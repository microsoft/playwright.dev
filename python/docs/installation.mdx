## Managing browser binaries

Each version of Playwright needs specific versions of browser binaries to operate. By default Playwright downloads Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers into the OS-specific cache folders:
- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright` on Windows
- `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` on MacOS
- `~/.cache/ms-playwright` on Linux

```sh
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

These browsers will take few hundreds of megabytes of the disk space when installed:

```sh
du -hs ./Library/Caches/ms-playwright/*
281M  chromium-XXXXXX
187M  firefox-XXXX
180M  webkit-XXXX
```

You can override default behavior using environment variables. When installing Playwright, ask it to download browsers into a specific location:

```sh
# Linux/macOS
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers python -m playwright install

# Windows
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

When running Playwright scripts, ask it to search for browsers in a shared location.

```sh
# Linux/macOS
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers python playwright_script.js

# Windows
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
python playwright_script.py
```

Or you can opt into the hermetic install and place binaries in the local folder:

```sh
# Linux/macOS
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0 playwright install

# Windows
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

Playwright keeps track of packages that need those browsers and will garbage collect them as you update Playwright to the newer versions.

:::note
Developers can opt-in in this mode via exporting `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers` in their `.bashrc`.

## Install behind the firewall or proxy

By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft CDN.

Sometimes companies maintain an internal proxy that blocks direct access to the public resources. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download browsers via a proxy server.

```sh
# Linux/macOS
pip install playwright
HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.168.1.78 playwright install

# Windows
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.168.1.78
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

## Download from artifact repository

By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft CDN.

Sometimes companies maintain an internal artifact repository to host browser binaries. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download from a custom location using the `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` env variable.

```sh
# Linux/macOS
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.168.1.78 playwright install

# Windows
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.168.1.78
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

It is also possible to use a per-browser download hosts using `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD_HOST`, `PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST` and `PLAYWRIGHT_WEBKIT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` env variables that take precedence over `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST`.

It is also possible to use a per-browser download hosts using `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD_HOST`, `PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST` and `PLAYWRIGHT_WEBKIT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` env variables that take precedence over `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST`.

```sh
# Linux/macOS
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.168.1.1 PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.168.1.78 python -m playwright install
```

## Skip browser downloads

In certain cases, it is desired to avoid browser downloads altogether because browser binaries are managed separately.

This can be done by setting `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD` variable before installation.

```sh
# Linux/macOS
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 python -m playwright install

# Windows
set PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

## Download single browser binary

Playwright downloads Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browsers by default. To install a specific browser, pass it as an argument during installation.

```sh
pip install playwright
playwright install firefox
```

## Stale browser removal

Playwright keeps track of the clients that use its browsers. When there are no more clients that require particular version of the browser, that version is deleted from the system. That way you can safely use Playwright instances of different versions and at the same time, you don't waste disk space for the browsers that are no longer in use.

To opt-out from the unused browser removal, you can set the `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_GC=1` environment variable.
