[Dockerfile.focal] can be used to run Playwright scripts in Docker environment. These image includes all the dependencies needed to run browsers in a Docker container, and also include the browsers themselves.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Image tags](#image-tags)

## Usage

This image is published on [Docker Hub].

### Pull the image

or pinned to a specific Playwright version (recommended). Replace 1.10.0 with your Playwright version:

### Run the image

By default, the Docker image will use the `root` user to run the browsers. This will disable the Chromium sandbox which is not available with root. If you run trusted code (e.g. End-to-end tests) and want to avoid the hassle of managing separate user then the root user may be fine. For web scraping or crawling, we recommend to create a separate user inside the Docker container and use the seccomp profile.

#### End-to-end tests

On trusted websites, you can avoid creating a separate user and use root for it since you trust the code which will run on the browsers.

#### Crawling and scraping

On untrusted websites, it's recommended to use a separate user for launching the browsers in combination with the seccomp profile. Inside the container or if you are using the Docker image as a base image you have to use `adduser` for it.

[`seccomp_profile.json`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/utils/docker/seccomp_profile.json) is needed to run Chromium with sandbox. This is a [default Docker seccomp profile](https://github.com/docker/engine/blob/d0d99b04cf6e00ed3fc27e81fc3d94e7eda70af3/profiles/seccomp/default.json) with extra user namespace cloning permissions:

```json
[
  {
    "comment": "Allow create user namespaces",
    "names": [
      "clone",
      "setns",
      "unshare"
    ],
    "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
    "args": [],
    "includes": {},
    "excludes": {}
  }
]
```

:::note
Using `--ipc=host` is recommended when using Chrome ([Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#ipc-settings---ipc)). Chrome can run out of memory without this flag.

### Using on CI

See our [Continuous Integration guides](./ci.mdx) for sample configs.

## Image tags

See [all available image tags].

Docker images are published automatically by GitHub Actions. We currently publish images with the following tags (`v1.10.0` in this case is an example:):
- `:next` - tip-of-tree image version based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- `:next-focal` - tip-of-tree image version based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- `:next-bionic` - tip-of-tree image version based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
- `:bionic` - last Playwright release docker image based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
- `:focal` - last Playwright release docker image based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa).
- `:v1.10.0` - Playwright v1.10.0 release docker image based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa).
- `:v1.10.0-focal` - Playwright v1.10.0 release docker image based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa).
- `:v1.10.0-bionic` - Playwright v1.10.0 release docker image based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver).
- `:sha-XXXXXXX` - docker image for every commit that changed docker files or browsers, marked with a [short sha](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection#Short-SHA-1) (first 7 digits of the SHA commit).

Status of push to MCR can be [verified here](https://mcrflow-status-ui.azurewebsites.net/) (internal link).

### Base images

We currently publish images based on the following [Ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) versions:
