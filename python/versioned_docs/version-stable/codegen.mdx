Playwright comes with the ability to generate tests out of the box and is a great way to quickly get started with testing. It will open two windows, a browser window where you interact with the website you wish to test and the Playwright Inspector window where you can record your tests, copy the tests, clear your tests as well as change the language of your tests.

## Running Codegen

```bash
playwright codegen playwright.dev
```

Run `codegen` and perform actions in the browser. Playwright will generate the code for the user interactions. `Codegen` will attempt to generate resilient text-based selectors.

## Emulate viewport size

Playwright opens a browser window with it's viewport set to a specific width and height and is not responsive as tests need to be run under the same conditions. Use the `--viewport` option to generate tests with a different viewport size.

```bash
playwright codegen --viewport-size=800,600 playwright.dev
```

## Emulate devices

Record scripts and tests while emulating a mobile device using the `--device` option which sets the viewport size and user agent among others.

```bash
playwright codegen --device="iPhone 11" playwright.dev
```

## Emulate color scheme

Record scripts and tests while emulating the color scheme with the `--color-scheme` option.

```bash
playwright codegen --color-scheme=dark playwright.dev
```

<img width="1258" alt="Codegen generating code for tests for playwright.dev website in dark mode" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/182359371-0bb4a7a2-abbb-4f73-8550-d67e0101f0ad.png" />

## Emulate geolocation, language and timezone

Record scripts and tests while emulating timezone, language & location using the `--timezone`, `--geolocation` and `--lang` options. Once page opens, click the "show your location" icon at them bottom right corner of the map to see geolocation in action.

```bash
playwright codegen --timezone="Europe/Rome" --geolocation="41.890221,12.492348" --lang="it-IT" maps.google.com
```

<img width="1276" alt="Codegen generating code for tests for google maps showing timezone, geoloation as Rome, Italy and in Italian language" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/182394434-73e1c2a8-767e-411a-94e4-0912c1c50ecc.png" />

## Preserve authenticated state

Run `codegen` with `--save-storage` to save [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) at the end of the session. This is useful to separately record an authentication step and reuse it later in the tests.

After performing authentication and closing the browser, `auth.json` will contain the storage state.

```bash
playwright codegen --save-storage=auth.json
```

<img width="1264" alt="Screenshot 2022-08-03 at 13 28 02" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/182599605-df2fbd05-622b-4cd7-8a32-0abdfea7d38d.png" />

Run with `--load-storage` to consume previously loaded storage. This way, all [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) will be restored, bringing most web apps to the authenticated state without the need to login again.

```bash
playwright codegen --load-storage=auth.json github.com/microsoft/playwright
```

<img width="1261" alt="Screenshot 2022-08-03 at 13 33 40" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/182599680-05297b4e-c258-4416-8daa-b8637c1db120.png" />

Use the `open` command with `--load-storage` to open the saved `auth.json`.

```bash
playwright open --load-storage=auth.json github.com/microsoft/playwright
```

## Record using custom setup

If you would like to use codegen in some non-standard setup (for example, use [browser_context.route(url, handler, **kwargs)](/api/class-browsercontext.mdx#browser-context-route)), it is possible to call [page.pause()](/api/class-page.mdx#page-pause) that will open a separate window with codegen controls.
