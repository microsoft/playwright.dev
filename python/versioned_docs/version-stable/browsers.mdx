## Introduction

Each version of Playwright needs specific versions of browser binaries to operate. You will need to use the Playwright CLI to install these browsers.

With every release, Playwright updates the versions of the browsers it supports, so that the latest Playwright would support the latest browsers at any moment. It means that every time you update Playwright, you might need to re-run the `install` CLI command.

## Install browsers

Playwright can install supported browsers. Running the command without arguments will install the default browsers.

```bash
playwright install
```

You can also install specific browsers by providing an argument:

```bash
playwright install webkit
```

See all supported browsers:

```bash
playwright install --help
```

## Install system dependencies

System dependencies can get installed automatically. This is useful for CI environments.

```bash
playwright install-deps
```

You can also install the dependencies for a single browser by passing it as an argument:

```bash
playwright install-deps chromium
```

It's also possible to combine `install-deps` with `install` so that the browsers and OS dependencies are installed with a single command.

```bash
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

See [system requirements](./intro.mdx#system-requirements) for officially supported operating systems.

## Configure Browsers

Playwright can run tests on Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers as well as branded browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It can also run on emulated tablet and mobile devices. See the [registry of device parameters](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/packages/playwright-core/src/server/deviceDescriptorsSource.json) for a complete list of selected desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

### Run tests on different browsers

Run tests on a specific browser:

```bash
pytest test_login.py --browser webkit
```

Run tests on multiple browsers:

```bash
pytest test_login.py --browser webkit --browser firefox
```

Test against mobile viewports:

```bash
pytest test_login.py --device="iPhone 13"
```

Test against branded browsers:

```bash
pytest test_login.py --browser-channel msedge
```

### Chromium

For Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, by default, Playwright uses open source Chromium builds. Since the Chromium project is ahead of the branded browsers, when the world is on Google Chrome N, Playwright already supports Chromium N+1 that will be released in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge a few weeks later.

### Chromium: headless shell

Playwright ships a regular Chromium build for headed operations and a separate [chromium headless shell](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-headless-shell) for headless mode.

If you are only running tests in headless shell (i.e. the `channel` option is **not** specified), for example on CI, you can avoid downloading the full Chromium browser by passing `--only-shell` during installation.

```bash
# only running tests headlessly
playwright install --with-deps --only-shell
```

### Chromium: new headless mode

You can opt into the new headless mode by using `'chromium'` channel. As [official Chrome documentation puts it](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-headless-shell):

> New Headless on the other hand is the real Chrome browser, and is thus more authentic, reliable, and offers more features. This makes it more suitable for high-accuracy end-to-end web app testing or browser extension testing.

See [issue #33566](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33566) for details.

```bash
pytest test_login.py --browser-channel chromium
```

With the new headless mode, you can skip downloading the headless shell during browser installation by using the `--no-shell` option:

```bash
# only running tests headlessly
playwright install --with-deps --no-shell
```

### Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge

While Playwright can download and use the recent Chromium build, it can operate against the branded Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers available on the machine (note that Playwright doesn't install them by default). In particular, the current Playwright version will support Stable and Beta channels of these browsers.

Available channels are `chrome`, `msedge`, `chrome-beta`, `msedge-beta`, `chrome-dev`, `msedge-dev`, `chrome-canary`, `msedge-canary`.

:::warning

Certain Enterprise Browser Policies may impact Playwright's ability to launch and control Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Running in an environment with browser policies is outside of the Playwright project's scope.
:::

:::warning
Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge have switched to a [new headless mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromium/headless) implementation that is closer to a regular headed mode. This differs from [chromium headless shell](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-headless-shell) that is used in Playwright by default when running headless, so expect different behavior in some cases. See [issue #33566](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/33566) for details.
:::

```bash
pytest test_login.py --browser-channel msedge
```

###### 
Alternatively when using the library directly, you can specify the browser [channel](/api/class-browsertype.mdx#browser-type-launch-option-channel) when launching the browser:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    # Channel can be "chrome", "msedge", "chrome-beta", "msedge-beta" or "msedge-dev".
    browser = p.chromium.launch(channel="msedge")
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://playwright.dev")
    print(page.title())
    browser.close()
```

#### Installing Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge

If Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge is not available on your machine, you can install them using the Playwright command line tool:

```bash
playwright install msedge
```

:::warning
Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge installations will be installed at the default global location of your operating system overriding your current browser installation.
:::

Run with the `--help` option to see a full a list of browsers that can be installed.

#### When to use Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge and when not to?

##### Defaults

Using the default Playwright configuration with the latest Chromium is a good idea most of the time. Since Playwright is ahead of Stable channels for the browsers, it gives peace of mind that the upcoming Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge releases won't break your site. You catch breakage early and have a lot of time to fix it before the official Chrome update.

##### Regression testing

Having said that, testing policies often require regression testing to be performed against the current publicly available browsers. In this case, you can opt into one of the stable channels, `"chrome"` or `"msedge"`.

##### Media codecs

Another reason for testing using official binaries is to test functionality related to media codecs. Chromium does not have all the codecs that Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge are bundling due to various licensing considerations and agreements. If your site relies on this kind of codecs (which is rarely the case), you will also want to use the official channel.

##### Enterprise policy

Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge respect enterprise policies, which include limitations to the capabilities, network proxy, mandatory extensions that stand in the way of testing. So if you are part of the organization that uses such policies, it is easiest to use bundled Chromium for your local testing, you can still opt into stable channels on the bots that are typically free of such restrictions.

### Firefox

Playwright's Firefox version matches the recent [Firefox Stable](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) build. Playwright doesn't work with the branded version of Firefox since it relies on patches.

Note that availability of certain features, which depend heavily on the underlying platform, may vary between operating systems. For example, available media codecs vary substantially between Linux, macOS and Windows.

### WebKit

Playwright's WebKit is derived from the latest WebKit main branch sources, often before these updates are incorporated into Apple Safari and other WebKit-based browsers. This gives a lot of lead time to react on the potential browser update issues. Playwright doesn't work with the branded version of Safari since it relies on patches. Instead, you can test using the most recent WebKit build.

Note that availability of certain features, which depend heavily on the underlying platform, may vary between operating systems. For example, available media codecs vary substantially between Linux, macOS and Windows. While running WebKit on Linux CI is usually the most affordable option, for the closest-to-Safari experience you should run WebKit on mac, for example if you do video playback.

## Install behind a firewall or a proxy

By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN.

Sometimes companies maintain an internal proxy that blocks direct access to the public resources. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download browsers via a proxy server.

<Tabs
  groupId="bash-flavor"
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    {label: 'Bash', value: 'bash'},
    {label: 'PowerShell', value: 'powershell'},
    {label: 'Batch', value: 'batch'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```bash
pip install playwright
HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 playwright install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell">

```powershell
$Env:HTTPS_PROXY="https://192.0.2.1"
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="batch">

```batch
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If the requests of the proxy get intercepted with a custom untrusted certificate authority (CA) and it yields to `Error: self signed certificate in certificate chain` while downloading the browsers, you must set your custom root certificates via the [`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_extra_ca_certsfile) environment variable before installing the browsers:

<Tabs
  groupId="bash-flavor"
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    {label: 'Bash', value: 'bash'},
    {label: 'PowerShell', value: 'powershell'},
    {label: 'Batch', value: 'batch'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```bash
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="/path/to/cert.pem"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell">

```powershell
$Env:NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="C:\certs\root.crt"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="batch">

```batch
set NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="C:\certs\root.crt"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If your network is slow to connect to Playwright browser archive, you can increase the connection timeout in milliseconds with `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` environment variable:

<Tabs
  groupId="bash-flavor"
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    {label: 'Bash', value: 'bash'},
    {label: 'PowerShell', value: 'powershell'},
    {label: 'Batch', value: 'batch'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```bash
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=120000 playwright install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell">

```powershell
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT="120000"
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="batch">

```batch
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=120000
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you are [installing dependencies](#install-system-dependencies) and need to use a proxy on Linux, make sure to run the command as a root user. Otherwise, Playwright will attempt to become a root and will not pass environment variables like `HTTPS_PROXY` to the linux package manager.

```bash
sudo HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 playwright install-deps
```

## Download from artifact repository

By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN.

Sometimes companies maintain an internal artifact repository to host browser binaries. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download from a custom location using the `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` env variable.

<Tabs
  groupId="bash-flavor"
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    {label: 'Bash', value: 'bash'},
    {label: 'PowerShell', value: 'powershell'},
    {label: 'Batch', value: 'batch'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```bash
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 playwright install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell">

```powershell
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST="http://192.0.2.1"
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="batch">

```batch
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

It is also possible to use a per-browser download hosts using `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD_HOST`, `PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST` and `PLAYWRIGHT_WEBKIT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` env variables that take precedence over `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST`.

<Tabs
  groupId="bash-flavor"
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    {label: 'Bash', value: 'bash'},
    {label: 'PowerShell', value: 'powershell'},
    {label: 'Batch', value: 'batch'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```bash
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://203.0.113.3 PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 playwright install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell">

```powershell
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST="http://203.0.113.3"
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST="http://192.0.2.1"
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="batch">

```batch
set PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://203.0.113.3
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Using a pre-installed Node.js

<Tabs
  groupId="bash-flavor"
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    {label: 'Bash', value: 'bash'},
    {label: 'PowerShell', value: 'powershell'},
    {label: 'Batch', value: 'batch'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```bash
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH="/usr/local/bin/node" playwright install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell">

```powershell
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH="C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe"
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="batch">

```batch
set PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH=C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Managing browser binaries

Playwright downloads Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers into the OS-specific cache folders:
- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright` on Windows
- `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` on macOS
- `~/.cache/ms-playwright` on Linux

These browsers will take a few hundred megabytes of disk space when installed:

```bash
du -hs ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/*
281M  chromium-XXXXXX
187M  firefox-XXXX
180M  webkit-XXXX
```

You can override default behavior using environment variables. When installing Playwright, ask it to download browsers into a specific location:

<Tabs
  groupId="bash-flavor"
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    {label: 'Bash', value: 'bash'},
    {label: 'PowerShell', value: 'powershell'},
    {label: 'Batch', value: 'batch'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```bash
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers python -m playwright install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell">

```powershell
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$Env:USERPROFILE\pw-browsers"
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="batch">

```batch
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When running Playwright scripts, ask it to search for browsers in a shared location.

<Tabs
  groupId="bash-flavor"
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    {label: 'Bash', value: 'bash'},
    {label: 'PowerShell', value: 'powershell'},
    {label: 'Batch', value: 'batch'}
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers python playwright_script.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell">

```powershell

$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$Env:USERPROFILE\pw-browsers"
python playwright_script.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="batch">

```batch
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
python playwright_script.py
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Playwright keeps track of packages that need those browsers and will garbage collect them as you update Playwright to the newer versions.

:::note

Developers can opt-in in this mode via exporting `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers` in their `.bashrc`.
:::

### Stale browser removal

Playwright keeps track of the clients that use its browsers. When there are no more clients that require a particular version of the browser, that version is deleted from the system. That way you can safely use Playwright instances of different versions and at the same time, you don't waste disk space for the browsers that are no longer in use.

To opt-out from the unused browser removal, you can set the `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_GC=1` environment variable.

### List all installed browsers:

Prints list of browsers from all playwright installations on the machine.

```bash
playwright install --list
```

### Uninstall browsers

This will remove the browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit) of the current Playwright installation:

```bash
playwright uninstall
```

To remove browsers of other Playwright installations as well, pass `--all` flag:

```bash
playwright uninstall --all
```
