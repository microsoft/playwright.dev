Playwright module provides a method to launch a browser instance. The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:

```java
import com.microsoft.playwright.*;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try (Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
      BrowserType chromium = playwright.chromium();
      Browser browser = chromium.launch();
      Page page = browser.newPage();
      page.navigate("http://example.com");
      // other actions...
      browser.close();
    }
  }
}
```


- [Playwright.close()](/api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-close)
- [Playwright.create([options])](/api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-create)
- [Playwright.chromium()](/api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-chromium)
- [Playwright.firefox()](/api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-firefox)
- [Playwright.request()](/api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-request)
- [Playwright.selectors()](/api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-selectors)
- [Playwright.webkit()](/api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-webkit)

## Playwright.close() {#playwright-close}

<font size="2" style={{position: "relative", top: "-20px"}}>Added in: v1.9</font>

- returns:<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="list-anchor-link" id="playwright-close-return"/> &#60;[void]&#62;<a href="#playwright-close-return" class="list-anchor">#</a>

Terminates this instance of Playwright, will also close all created browsers if they are still running.

## Playwright.create([options]) {#playwright-create}

<font size="2" style={{position: "relative", top: "-20px"}}>Added in: v1.10</font>

- `options` &#60;`Playwright.CreateOptions`&#62;
  - `setEnv`<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="list-anchor-link" id="playwright-create-option-env"/> &#60;[Map]<[String], [String]>&#62; Additional environment variables that will be passed to the driver process. By default driver process inherits environment variables of the Playwright process. <font size="2">Added in: v1.13</font><a href="#playwright-create-option-env" class="list-anchor">#</a>
- returns:<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="list-anchor-link" id="playwright-create-return"/> &#60;[Playwright]&#62;<a href="#playwright-create-return" class="list-anchor">#</a>

Launches new Playwright driver process and connects to it. [Playwright.close()](/api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-close) should be called when the instance is no longer needed.

```java
Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
Browser browser = playwright.webkit().launch();
Page page = browser.newPage();
page.navigate("https://www.w3.org/");
playwright.close();
```

<font size="2" style={{position: "relative", top: "-20px"}}>Added in: v1.8</font>

- returns: &#60;[BrowserType]&#62;

This object can be used to launch or connect to Chromium, returning instances of [Browser].

## Playwright.firefox() {#playwright-firefox}
