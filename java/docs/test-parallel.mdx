Playwright Test runs tests in parallel by default, using multiple worker processes.

- [Workers](#workers)
- [Shards](#shards)

## Workers

Each worker process creates a new environment to run tests. By default, Playwright Test reuses the worker as much as it can to make testing faster.

However, test runner will create a new worker when retrying tests, after any test failure, to initialize a new environment, or just to speed up test execution if the worker limit is not reached.

You can control the maximum number of worker processes via [command line](./test-cli.mdx) or in the [configuration file](./test-configuration.mdx).
- Run in parallel by default

  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```

- Disable parallelization

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --worker 1
  ```

- Control the number of workers

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --worker 4
  ```

- In the configuration file

Each worker process is assigned a unique sequential index that is accessible through the [`workerInfo`](./test-advanced.mdx#workerinfo) object.

## Shards

Playwright Test can shard a test suite, so that it can be executed on multiple machines. For that,  pass `--shard=x/y` to the command line. For example, to split the suite into three shards, each running one third of the tests:

```bash
npx playwright test --shard=1/3
npx playwright test --shard=2/3
npx playwright test --shard=3/3
```
