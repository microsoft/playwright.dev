Playwright Inspector is a GUI tool that helps authoring and debugging Playwright scripts.

## Open Playwright Inspector

There are several ways of opening Playwright Inspector:
- Set the `PWDEBUG` environment variable to run your scripts in debug mode. This configures Playwright for debugging and opens the inspector.

  ```sh
  # Linux/macOS
  $ PWDEBUG=1 PLAYWRIGHT_JAVA_SRC=<java src root> mvn test
  
  # Windows
  $ set PLAYWRIGHT_JAVA_SRC=<java src root>
  $ set PWDEBUG=1
  $ mvn test
  ```

  Additional useful defaults are configured when `PWDEBUG=1` is set:
  - Browsers launch in the headed mode
  - Default timeout is set to 0 (= no timeout)
- Call [Page.pause()](./api/class-page.mdx#pagepause) method from your script when running in headed browser.

  ```java
  // Pause on the following line.
  page.pause();
  ```

- Use `open` or `codegen` commands in the Playwright [CLI](./cli.mdx):

  ```sh
  $ mvn exec:java -e -Dexec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -Dexec.args="codegen wikipedia.org"
  ```

## Stepping through the Playwright script

When `PWDEBUG=1` is set, Playwright Inspector window will be opened and the script will be paused on the first Playwright statement:

Now we know what action is about to be performed and we can look into the details on that action. For example, when stopped on an input action such as `click`, the exact point Playwright is about to click is highlighted with the large red dot on the inspected page:

<img width="344" alt="Red dot on inspected page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/883973/108614363-b69a4780-73ae-11eb-8f5e-51f9c91ec9b4.png"></img>

By the time Playwright has paused on that click action, it has already performed actionability checks that can be found in the log:

If actionability can't be reached, it'll show action as pending:

You can step over each action using the "Step over" action or resume script without further pauses:

## Using Browser Developer Tools

You can use browser developer tools in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit while running a Playwright script, with or without Playwright inspector. Developer tools help to:
* Inspect the DOM tree
* **See console logs** during execution (or learn how to [read logs via API](./verification.mdx#console-logs))
* Check **network activity** and other developer tools features

:::note
**For WebKit**: launching WebKit Inspector during the execution will   prevent the Playwright script from executing any further.

## Debugging Selectors
- Click the Explore button to hover over elements in the screen and click them to automatically generate selectors for those elements.
- To verify where selector points, paste it into the inspector input field:

## Recording scripts

At any moment, clicking Record action enables recorder (codegen) mode. Every action on the target page is turned into the generated script:

You can copy entire generated script or clear it using toolbar actions.
