## Introduction

Playwright tests can be ran on any CI provider. In this section we will cover running tests on GitHub using GitHub actions. If you would like to see how to configure other CI providers check out our detailed doc on Continuous Integration.

To add a [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) file first create `.github/workflows` folder and inside it add a `playwright.yml` file containing the example code below so that your tests will run on each push and pull request for the main/master branch.

#### You will learn

- [How to view test logs](/ci-intro.mdx#viewing-test-logs)
- [How to view the trace](/ci-intro.mdx#viewing-the-trace)

## Setting up GitHub Actions

### On push/pull_request

Tests will run on push or pull request on branches main/master. The [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows) will install all dependencies, install Playwright and then run the tests.

```yml title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: '17'
    - name: Build & Install
      run: mvn -B install -D skipTests --no-transfer-progress
    - name: Install Playwright
      run: mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install --with-deps"
    - name: Run tests
      run: mvn test
```

### Via Containers

GitHub Actions support [running jobs in a container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/running-jobs-in-a-container) by using the [`jobs.<job_id>.container`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontainer) option. This is useful to not pollute the host environment with dependencies and to have a consistent environment for e.g. screenshots/visual regression testing across different operating systems.

```yml title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  playwright:
    name: 'Playwright Tests'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/java:v1.42.0-jammy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '17'
      - name: Build & Install
        run: mvn -B install -D skipTests --no-transfer-progress
      - name: Run tests
        run: mvn test
        env:
          HOME: /root
```

### On deployment

This will start the tests after a [GitHub Deployment](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/) went into the `success` state. Services like Vercel use this pattern so you can run your end-to-end tests on their deployed environment.

```yml title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  deployment_status:
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: '17'
    - name: Build & Install
      run: mvn -B install -D skipTests --no-transfer-progress
    - name: Install Playwright
      run: mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install --with-deps"
    - name: Run tests
      run: mvn test
      env:
        # This might depend on your test-runner
        PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_BASE_URL: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}
```

## Create a Repo and Push to GitHub

Once you have your [GitHub actions workflow](#setting-up-github-actions) setup then all you need to do is [Create a repo on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) or push your code to an existing repository. Follow the instructions on GitHub and don't forget to [initialize a git repository](https://github.com/git-guides/git-init) using the `git init` command so you can [add](https://github.com/git-guides/git-add), [commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) and [push](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push) your code.

## Opening the Workflows

Click on the **Actions** tab to see the workflows. Here you will see if your tests have passed or failed.

<img width="847" alt="Opening the Workflows" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183423584-2ea18038-cd49-4daa-a20c-2205352f0933.png"/>

On Pull Requests you can also click on the **Details** link in the [PR status check](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks).

<img width="645" alt="pr status checked" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183722462-17a985db-0e10-4205-b16c-8aaac36117b9.png" />

## Viewing Test Logs

Clicking on the workflow run will show you the all the actions that GitHub performed and clicking on **Run Playwright tests** will show the error messages, what was expected and what was received as well as the call log.

## Viewing the Trace

[trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) is a statically hosted variant of the Trace Viewer. You can upload trace files using drag and drop.
