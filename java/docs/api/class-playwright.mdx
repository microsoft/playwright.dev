Playwright module provides a method to launch a browser instance. The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:

```java
import com.microsoft.playwright.*;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try (Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
      BrowserType chromium = playwright.chromium();
      Browser browser = chromium.launch();
      Page page = browser.newPage();
      page.navigate("http://example.com");
      // other actions...
      browser.close();
    }
  }
}
```


- [Playwright.close()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-close)
- [Playwright.create([options])](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-create)
- [Playwright.chromium()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-chromium)
- [Playwright.firefox()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-firefox)
- [Playwright.selectors()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-selectors)
- [Playwright.webkit()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-webkit)

## Playwright.close() {#playwright-close}
- returns:<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="list-anchor-link" id="playwright-close-return"/> &#60;[void]&#62;<a href="#playwright-close-return" class="list-anchor">#</a>

Terminates this instance of Playwright, will also close all created browsers if they are still running.

## Playwright.create([options]) {#playwright-create}
- `options` &#60;`Playwright.CreateOptions`&#62;
  - `setEnv`<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="list-anchor-link" id="playwright-create-option-env"/> &#60;[Map]<[String], [String]>&#62; Additional environment variables that will be passed to the driver process. By default driver process inherits environment variables of the Playwright process.<a href="#playwright-create-option-env" class="list-anchor">#</a>
- returns:<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="list-anchor-link" id="playwright-create-return"/> &#60;[Playwright]&#62;<a href="#playwright-create-return" class="list-anchor">#</a>

Launches new Playwright driver process and connects to it. [Playwright.close()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwright-close) should be called when the instance is no longer needed.

```java
Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
Browser browser = playwright.webkit().launch();
Page page = browser.newPage();
page.navigate("https://www.w3.org/");
playwright.close();
```

## Playwright.chromium() {#playwright-chromium}
- returns: &#60;[BrowserType]&#62;

## Playwright.firefox() {#playwright-firefox}
- returns: &#60;[BrowserType]&#62;

This object can be used to launch or connect to Firefox, returning instances of [Browser].

## Playwright.selectors() {#playwright-selectors}
- returns: &#60;[Selectors]&#62;

Selectors can be used to install custom selector engines. See [Working with selectors](./selectors.mdx) for more information.
