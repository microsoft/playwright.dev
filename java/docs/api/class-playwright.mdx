Playwright module provides a method to launch a browser instance. The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:

```java
import com.microsoft.playwright.*;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try (Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
      BrowserType chromium = playwright.chromium();
      Browser browser = chromium.launch();
      Page page = browser.newPage();
      page.navigate("http://example.com");
      // other actions...
      browser.close();
    }
  }
}
```


- [Playwright.close()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwrightclose)
- [Playwright.create()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwrightcreate)
- [Playwright.chromium()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwrightchromium)
- [Playwright.firefox()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwrightfirefox)
- [Playwright.selectors()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwrightselectors)
- [Playwright.webkit()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwrightwebkit)

## Playwright.close()
- returns: <[void]>

Terminates this instance of Playwright, will also close all created browsers if they are still running.

## Playwright.create()
- returns: <[Playwright]>

Launches new Playwright driver process and connects to it. [Playwright.close()](./api/class-playwright.mdx#playwrightclose) should be called when the instance is no longer needed.

```java
Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
Browser browser = playwright.webkit().launch();
Page page = browser.newPage();
page.navigate("https://www.w3.org/");
playwright.close();
```

## Playwright.chromium()
- returns: <[BrowserType]>

This object can be used to launch or connect to Chromium, returning instances of [Browser].

## Playwright.firefox()
- returns: <[BrowserType]>

This object can be used to launch or connect to Firefox, returning instances of [Browser].

## Playwright.selectors()
- returns: <[Selectors]>

Selectors can be used to install custom selector engines. See [Working with selectors](./selectors.mdx) for more information.

## Playwright.webkit()
- returns: <[BrowserType]>

This object can be used to launch or connect to WebKit, returning instances of [Browser].
