description: Guidance on saving traces, specifying output directories, and other debugging tips for Playwright MCP.
---

When working with Playwright MCP, it's often helpful to save traces and other output artifacts like screenshots or PDFs.
They can help in debugging and analysis, troubleshooting and reporting.

### Saving a Trace of the Session

The Playwright MCP can record a detailed trace of the session, which is invaluable for debugging. Use the `--save-trace` flag to enable this feature. The trace file will be saved in the `.playwright-mcp` directory.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--save-trace"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Open the saved trace (must be zipped before viewing or sharing):

1. Locate the trace folder under `.playwright-mcp/` (e.g. `.playwright-mcp/trace-<timestamp>`).
2. Zip it and rename it to `trace.zip`, and then launch the Trace Viewer:
  ```bash
  npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
  ```

### Saving a log of the MCP Session

The Playwright MCP can also record a log of MCP tool calls, the responses and what the browser looked like.
To enable it, add the `--save-session` flag.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--isolated",
        "--save-session"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Screenshots

Playwright can capture screenshots of the current page via the MCP server. Ask the agent to navigate to a page and save a screenshot.

Typical flow:
1. Navigate to the page.
2. Optionally set viewport and expand sections you want visible.
3. Save a screenshot.

#### Example Prompt full page screenshot

```bash
Navigate to playwright.dev and take a screenshot and save it as playwright.png
```

#### Example Prompt partial screenshot

```bash
navigate to playwright.dev and find the footer and take a screenshot of it
```

## PDF Generation

PDF generation lets the agent render the current page to a PDF file which is useful for creating print-friendly versions of web content.

This is opt-in, so you need to add the `--caps=pdf` argument to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest", 
        "--caps=pdf"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example Prompt for PDF generation

```bash
navigate to playwright.dev, wait for images to load and save the page as a PDF named "mcp-test.pdf".
```

## Setting the Output Directory

By default the artifacts are written to the MCP server's artifacts location.
If you set `--output-dir` the files will be written there; otherwise the server may use a default like `.playwright-mcp/`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--output-dir",
        "full/path/to/output/folder"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Agents on CI

Running an agent on CI is useful for automation and development purposes.
For proper observability into what the agent is doing, the trace and session log features above are useful, but there's more to consider.

By default, Playwright MCP launches a headed browser so you can see the automation happen.
For CI/CD environments or when a visible UI is not needed, you can run in headless mode using the `--headless` flag.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--headless"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Also, consider running `npx playwright install` in CI to ensure browsers are downloaded before the agent starts.
This can save the agent from having to install browsers at the beginning.
