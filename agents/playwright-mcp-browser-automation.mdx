Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a powerful tool that allows AI agents to automate and interact with web browsers.
It acts as a server, providing browser automation capabilities through the Playwright framework.
This enables Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT or Claude to understand and interact with web pages using structured data from accessibility snapshots.

With Playwright MCP, you can instruct an AI to perform tasks like browsing websites, clicking buttons, filling forms, uploading files, and much more.

## Let's Get Started

In this guide, we'll walk through a simple workflow to demonstrate how you can use Playwright MCP to automate a task on GitHub: navigating to a repository and starring it.

If you haven't already configured your MCP client to use the Playwright MCP server, please follow [the instructions](./index.mdx#getting-started).

### Step 1: Navigate to the Repository

First, instruct the agent to navigate to the Playwright MCP GitHub repository. You can do this with a simple prompt.

```bash
Go to the Playwright MCP repo
```

The agent will use the `browser_navigate` tool from the Playwright MCP server to open the page in a new browser window.

### Step 2: Sign in to GitHub

Once on the repository page, the agent will use the `browser_snapshot` tool from the Playwright MCP server to take a page snapshot
which is a representation of the current state of the page through the accessibility tree.

Ask it to sign in:

```bash
Sign in
```

<ProgressiveImage image={require('./github-sign-in.png')} alt="Agent using browser_click tool, github login window visible in background" />

The agent will use the `browser_click` tool to click the "Sign in" button.

For security reasons, it's not recommended to share your credentials with the AI.
You can manually enter your username and password in the browser window that Playwright opened and then let the agent continue once you're signed in.

### Step 3: Star the Repository

After you've signed in, you can instruct the agent to star the repository.

```bash
star the repo
```

<ProgressiveImage image={require('./star-repo.png')} alt="Agent using browser_click tool, starred github repo visible in background" />

The agent will then perform the action using the `browser_click` tool, and you'll see the repository get a new star.

That's a quick look at the power of Playwright MCP. This technology opens up a new world of possibilities for how AI agents can interact with the web.
