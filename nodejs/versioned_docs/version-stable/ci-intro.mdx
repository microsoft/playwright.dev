## Introduction

Playwright tests can be ran on any CI provider. In this section we will cover running tests on GitHub using GitHub actions. If you would like to see how to configure other CI providers check out our detailed [doc on Continuous Integration](./ci.mdx).

When [installing Playwright](./intro.mdx) using the [VS Code extension](./getting-started-vscode.mdx) or with `npm init playwright@latest` you are given the option to add a [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). This creates a `playwright.yml` file inside a `.github/workflows` folder containing everything you need so that your tests run on each push and pull request into the main/master branch.

## Setting up GitHub Actions

### On push/pull_request

Tests will run on push or pull request on branches main/master. The [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows) will install all dependencies, install Playwright and then run the tests. It will also create the HTML report.

```yml title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install Playwright Browsers
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      if: always()
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: playwright-report/
        retention-days: 30
```

### On push/pull_request (sharded)

GitHub Actions supports [sharding tests between multiple jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs). Check out our [sharding doc](./test-sharding) to learn more about sharding and to see a [GitHub actions example](./test-sharding.mdx#github-actions-example) of how to configure a job to run your tests on multiple machines as well as how to merge the HTML reports.

### Via Containers

GitHub Actions support [running jobs in a container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/running-jobs-in-a-container) by using the [`jobs.<job_id>.container`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontainer) option. This is useful to not pollute the host environment with dependencies and to have a consistent environment for e.g. screenshots/visual regression testing across different operating systems.

```yml title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  playwright:
    name: 'Playwright Tests'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.37.1-jammy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run your tests
        run: npx playwright test
```

### On deployment

This will start the tests after a [GitHub Deployment](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/) went into the `success` state. Services like Vercel use this pattern so you can run your end-to-end tests on their deployed environment.

```yml title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  deployment_status:
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install Playwright
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
      env:
        PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_BASE_URL: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}
```

## Create a Repo and Push to GitHub

Once you have your [GitHub actions workflow](#setting-up-github-actions) setup then all you need to do is [Create a repo on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) or push your code to an existing repository. Follow the instructions on GitHub and don't forget to [initialize a git repository](https://github.com/git-guides/git-init) using the `git init` command so you can [add](https://github.com/git-guides/git-add), [commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) and [push](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push) your code.

<img width="861" alt="Create a Repo and Push to GitHub" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183423254-d2735278-a2ab-4d63-bb99-48d8e5e447bc.png"/>

## Opening the Workflows

Click on the **Actions** tab to see the workflows. Here you will see if your tests have passed or failed.

<img width="847" alt="Opening the Workflows" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183423584-2ea18038-cd49-4daa-a20c-2205352f0933.png"/>

On Pull Requests you can also click on the **Details** link in the [PR status check](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks).

<img width="645" alt="pr status checked" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183722462-17a985db-0e10-4205-b16c-8aaac36117b9.png" />

## Viewing Test Logs

Clicking on the workflow run will show you the all the actions that GitHub performed and clicking on **Run Playwright tests** will show the error messages, what was expected and what was received as well as the call log.

<img width="839" alt="Viewing Test Logs" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183423783-58bf2008-514e-4f96-9c12-c9a55703960c.png"/>

## HTML Report

The HTML Report shows you a full report of your tests. You can filter the report by browsers, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests and flaky tests.

### Downloading the HTML Report

In the Artifacts section click on the **playwright-report** to download your report in the format of a zip file.

<img width="972" alt="Downloading the HTML Report" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183437023-524f1803-84e4-4862-9ce3-1d55af0e023e.png" />

### Viewing the HTML Report

Locally opening the report will not work as expected as you need a web server in order for everything to work correctly. First, extract the zip, preferably in a folder that already has Playwright installed. Using the command line change into the directory where the report is and use `npx playwright show-report` followed by the name of the extracted folder. This will serve up the report and enable you to view it in your browser.

```bash
npx playwright show-report name-of-my-extracted-playwright-report
```

<img width="1404" alt="Playwright HTML Report" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/212745273-c19487d2-bc5e-483f-9f67-f9c9e5413ff4.png" />

To learn more about reports check out our detailed guide on [HTML Reporter](/test-reporters.mdx#html-reporter)

## Viewing the Trace

Once you have served the report using `npx playwright show-report`, click on the trace icon next to the test's file name as seen in the image above. You can then view the trace of your tests and inspect each action to try to find out why the tests are failing.

<img width="1976" alt="Playwright Trace Viewer" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/212869694-61368b16-f176-4083-bbc2-fc85b95131f0.png" />

## Publishing report on the web

Downloading the HTML report as a zip file is not very convenient. However, we can utilize Azure Storage's static websites hosting capabilities to easily and efficiently serve HTML reports on the Internet, requiring minimal configuration.
1. Create an [Azure Storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create).
1. Enable [Static website hosting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-how-to#enable-static-website-hosting) for the storage account.
1. Create a Service Principal in Azure and grant it access to Azure Blob storage. Upon successful execution, the command will display the credentials which will be used in the next step.
   
   ```bash
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-actions" --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>
   ```
   
1. Use the credentials from the previous step to set up encrypted secrets in your GitHub repository. Go to your repository's settings, under [GitHub Actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository), and add the following secrets:
   - `AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID`
   - `AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `AZCOPY_TENANT_ID`
   
   For a detailed guide on how to authorize a service principal using a client secret, refer to [this Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-authorize-azure-active-directory#authorize-a-service-principal-by-using-a-client-secret-1).
1. Add a step that uploads the HTML report to Azure Storage.
   
   ```yaml title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
   ...
       - name: Upload HTML report to Azure
         shell: bash
         run: |
           REPORT_DIR='run-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}'
           azcopy cp --recursive "./playwright-report/*" "https://<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/\$web/$REPORT_DIR"
           echo "::notice title=HTML report url::https://<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.z1.web.core.windows.net/$REPORT_DIR/index.html"
         env:
           AZCOPY_AUTO_LOGIN_TYPE: SPN
           AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID }}'
           AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET }}'
           AZCOPY_TENANT_ID: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_TENANT_ID }}'
   ```
   
The contents of the `$web` storage container can be accessed from a browser by using the [public URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-how-to?tabs=azure-portal#portal-find-url) of the website.

:::note
This step will not work for pull requests created from a forked repository because such workflow [doesn't have access to the secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow).
