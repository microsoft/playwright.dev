### Capabilities

Playwright is a library to automate [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is **ever-green**, **capable**, **reliable** and **fast**.

* Ever-green browser engines
* Headless execution
* Scenarios that span multiple pages, domains and iframes
* Auto-wait for elements to be ready before executing actions (like click, fill)
* Reliable signals instead of timeouts (like network response, popup, navigation)
* Intercept network activity for stubbing and mocking network requests
* Emulate mobile devices, geolocation, permissions
* Support for web components via shadow-piercing selectors
* Native input events for mouse and keyboard
* Upload and download files
