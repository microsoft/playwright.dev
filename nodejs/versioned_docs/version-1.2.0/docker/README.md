## Usage

[![docker hub](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-mcr.microsoft.com%2Fplaywright-blue)](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-playwright)

This image is published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-playwright).

### Pull the image

```
$ docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:bionic
```

### Run the image

```
$ docker container run -it --rm --ipc=host --security-opt seccomp=chrome.json mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:bionic /bin/bash
```

Note that:

* The seccomp profile is required to run Chrome without sandbox. Thanks to [Jessie Frazelle](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles/blob/master/etc/docker/seccomp/chrome.json).
* Using `--ipc=host` is also recommended when using Chrome ([Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#ipc-settings---ipc)). Chrome can run out of memory without this flag.

### Using on CI

See our [Continuous Integration guides](../ci.md) for sample configs.

## Development

### Build the image

```
$ docker build -t mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:bionic -f Dockerfile.bionic .
```

### Push

Playwright on Docker Hub relies on

```
$ docker push playwright.azurecr.io/public/playwright:bionic
```

## Base images

`playwright:bionic` is based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver).

### Alpine

Browser builds for Firefox and WebKit are built for the [glibc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_C_Library) library. Alpine Linux and other distributions that are based on the [musl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musl) standard library are not supported.
