## Managing browser binaries

Each version of Playwright needs specific versions of browser binaries to operate. By default Playwright downloads Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers into the OS-specific cache folders:
- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright` on Windows
- `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` on MacOS
- `~/.cache/ms-playwright` on Linux

```sh
npm i -D playwright
```

These browsers will take few hundreds of megabytes of the disk space when installed:

```sh
du -hs ./Library/Caches/ms-playwright/*
281M  chromium-XXXXXX
187M  firefox-XXXX
180M  webkit-XXXX
```

You can override default behavior using environment variables. When installing Playwright, ask it to download browsers into a specific location:

```sh
# Linux/macOS
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers npm i -D playwright

# Windows
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
npm i -D playwright
```

When running Playwright scripts, ask it to search for browsers in a shared location.

```sh
# Linux/macOS
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers node playwright-script.js

# Windows
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
node playwright-script.js
```

Or you can opt into the hermetic install and place binaries in the local folder:

```sh
# Linux/macOS
# Places binaries to node_modules/playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0 npm i -D playwright

# Windows
# Places binaries to node_modules\playwright
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0
npm i -D playwright
```

Playwright keeps track of packages that need those browsers and will garbage collect them as you update Playwright to the newer versions.

:::note
Developers can opt-in in this mode via exporting `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers` in their `.bashrc`.
:::

## Install behind the firewall or proxy

By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft CDN.

Sometimes companies maintain an internal proxy that blocks direct access to the public resources. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download browsers via a proxy server.

```sh
# Linux/macOS
HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.168.1.78 npm i -D playwright

# Windows
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.168.1.78
npm i -D playwright
```

## Download from artifact repository

By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft CDN.

Sometimes companies maintain an internal artifact repository to host browser binaries. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download from a custom location using the `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` env variable.

```sh
# Linux/macOS
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.168.1.78 npm i -D playwright

# Windows
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.168.1.78
npm i -D playwright
```

It is also possible to use a per-browser download hosts using `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD_HOST`, `PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST` and `PLAYWRIGHT_WEBKIT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` env variables that take precedence over `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST`.

It is also possible to use a per-browser download hosts using `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD_HOST`, `PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST` and `PLAYWRIGHT_WEBKIT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` env variables that take precedence over `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST`.

```sh
# Linux/macOS
PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.168.1.1 PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.168.1.78 npm i -D playwright
```

## Skip browser downloads

In certain cases, it is desired to avoid browser downloads altogether because browser binaries are managed separately.

This can be done by setting `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD` variable before installation.

```sh
# Linux/macOS
PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm i -D playwright

# Windows
set PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
npm i -D playwright
```

## Download single browser binary

Playwright ships three packages that bundle only a single browser:
- [`playwright-chromium`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-chromium)
- [`playwright-webkit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-webkit)
- [`playwright-firefox`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-firefox)

:::note
All configuration environment variables also apply to these packages.
:::

Using these packages is as easy as using a regular Playwright:

Install a specific package

```sh
npm i -D playwright-webkit
```

Require package

```js
// Notice a proper package name in require
const { webkit } = require('playwright-webkit');

(async () => {
  const browser = await webkit.launch();
  // ...
})();
```

## Stale browser removal

Playwright keeps track of the clients that use its browsers. When there are no more clients that require particular version of the browser, that version is deleted from the system. That way you can safely use Playwright instances of different versions and at the same time, you don't waste disk space for the browsers that are no longer in use.

To opt-out from the unused browser removal, you can set the `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_GC=1` environment variable.
