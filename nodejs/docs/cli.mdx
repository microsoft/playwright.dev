Playwright comes with the command line tools that run via `npx` or as a part of the `npm` scripts.

## Usage

```sh
npx playwright --help
```

```json
# Running from `package.json` script
{
  "scripts": {
    "help": "playwright --help"
  }
}
```

## Generate code

```sh
npx playwright codegen wikipedia.org
```

Run `codegen` and perform actions in the browser. Playwright CLI will generate JavaScript code for the user interactions. `codegen` will attempt to generate resilient text-based selectors.

### Preserve authenticated state

Run `codegen` with `--save-storage` to save [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) at the end. This is useful to separately record authentication step and reuse it later.

```sh
npx playwright codegen --save-storage=auth.json
# Perform authentication and exit.
# auth.json will contain the storage state.
```

Run with `--load-storage` to consume previously loaded storage. This way, all [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) will be restored, bringing most web apps to the authenticated state.

```sh
npx playwright open --load-storage=auth.json my.web.app
npx playwright codegen --load-storage=auth.json my.web.app
# Perform actions in authenticated state.
```

### Codegen with custom setup

If you would like to use codegen in some non-standard setup (for example, use [browserContext.route(url, handler)](./api/class-browsercontext.mdx#browsercontextrouteurl-handler)), it is possible to call [page.pause()](./api/class-page.mdx#pagepause) that will open a separate window with codegen controls.

```js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  // Make sure to run headed.
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });

  // Setup context however you like.
  const context = await browser.newContext({ /* pass any options */ });
  await context.route('**/*', route => route.continue());

  // Pause the page, and start recording manually.
  const page = await context.newPage();
  await page.pause();
})();
```

## Open pages

With `open`, you can use Playwright bundled browsers to browse web pages. Playwright provides cross-platform WebKit builds that can be used to reproduce Safari rendering across Windows, Linux and macOS.

```sh
# Open page in Chromium
npx playwright open example.com
```

```sh
# Open page in WebKit
npx playwright wk example.com
```

### Emulate devices

`open` can emulate mobile and tablet devices from the [`playwright.devices`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright#playwrightdevices) list.

```sh
# Emulate iPhone 11.
npx playwright open --device="iPhone 11" wikipedia.org
```

### Emulate color scheme and viewport size

```sh
# Emulate screen size and color scheme.
npx playwright open --viewport-size=800,600 --color-scheme=dark twitter.com
```

### Emulate geolocation, language and timezone

```sh
# Emulate timezone, language & location
# Once page opens, click the "my location" button to see geolocation in action
npx playwright open --timezone="Europe/Rome" --geolocation="41.890221,12.492348" --lang="it-IT" maps.google.com
```

## Inspect selectors

During `open` or `codegen`, you can use following API inside the developer tools console of any browser.

#### playwright.$(selector)

Query Playwright selector, using the actual Playwright query engine, for example:

```js
> playwright.$('.auth-form >> text=Log in');

<button>Log in</button>
```

#### playwright.$$(selector)

Same as `playwright.$`, but returns all matching elements.

```js
> playwright.$$('li >> text=John')

> [<li>, <li>, <li>, <li>]
```

#### playwright.inspect(selector)

Reveal element in the Elements panel (if DevTools of the respective browser supports it).

```js
> playwright.inspect('text=Log in')
```

#### playwright.selector(element)

Generates selector for the given element.

```js
> playwright.selector($0)

"div[id="glow-ingress-block"] >> text=/.*Hello.*/"
```

## Take screenshot

```sh
# See command help
npx playwright screenshot --help
```

```sh
# Wait 3 seconds before capturing a screenshot after page loads ('load' event fires)
npx playwright screenshot \
    --device="iPhone 11" \
    --color-scheme=dark \
    --wait-for-timeout=3000 \
    twitter.com twitter-iphone.png
```

```sh
# Capture a full page screenshot
npx playwright screenshot --full-page en.wikipedia.org wiki-full.png
```

## Generate PDF

PDF generation only works in Headless Chromium.

```sh
# See command help
npx playwright pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF wiki.pdf
```

## Install system dependencies

Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 system dependencies can get installed automatically. This is useful for CI environments.

```sh
# See command help
npx playwright install-deps
```

You can also install the dependencies for a single browser only by passing it as an argument:

```sh
npx playwright install-deps chromium
```

## Known limitations

Opening WebKit Web Inspector will disconnect Playwright from the browser. In such cases, code generation will stop.
